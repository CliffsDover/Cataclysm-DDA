[A chainsaw may seem like a great weapon, but remember that they're slow, unwieldy, and very noisy.] 鏈鋸看起來是很好的武器，但是使用時速度很慢，不好拿，而且又很吵。

[BB guns may seem like a joke, but they've got their uses.  They're good for hunting small game, or getting to know the basics of rifles.] BB槍看起來像是搞笑武器，但是也是有它的用處。在進行小動物狩獵時很有用，同時也能當做練習步槍技能的工具。
[Backpacks let you carry lots of stuff, but they limit your movement a lot.  If you're an unarmed fighter, don't wear one!] 背包能讓你背負許多東西，但是也限制了你的行動。假如你走肉搏路線，最好是別帶！
[Be careful eating wild mushrooms.  Some are poisonous, and others can make you hallucinate.] 食用野生蘑菇時要小心。某些會讓你中毒，或是讓你產生幻覺。
[Be careful of drinking water from rivers and stuff, it's a good way to get sick.  But if you have a water purifier, it'll make it safe.] 從河裡或其他地方喝水要小心，很容易讓你生病。但若你有淨水器的話，就可以安心了。
[Bear traps are a nice way to cover an escape.  If you place one in a doorway, the first zombie through will get stuck, and the rest won't be able to get past!] 捕獸夾是用來掩護脫逃的好東西。若是你放一個在走廊上，走在最前面的殭屍被夾到後，其他的殭屍就會被堵住！
[Bubblewrap is pretty harmless, but setting it up around you before going to sleep will keep you from waking up to a zombie punching you.] 泡泡紙相當無害，但是在你睡覺時設置在四周，能夠讓你在被殭屍包圍前醒來。
[Carrying a lighter is something all veterans do.  It takes up almost no space, and can easily save your life.] 老手都會帶個打火機。打火機不佔空間而且還能救你的命。
[Crossbows are a great weapon for long term use.  Most of the time, you can retrieve the bolt after shooting it, so running out of ammo is less of a concern.] 十字弓是很適合長期使用的武器。大部分的情況，你都能夠在射擊後重新取回箭矢，所以不太需要擔心彈藥用盡的問題。
[Crowbars not only make a pretty good weapon, they're also useful for opening locked doors and lifting manhole covers.] 撬棍不只是能當武器，同時也能撬開鎖住的門以及移開人孔蓋。
[Don't fire your gun if you can help it--the noise attracts monsters!] 萬不得已盡量別用槍--槍聲會引來更多怪物！
[Don't light a Molotov until you're ready to throw it.  Not only can they go out, but if you accidentally drop it or something, you're in trouble.] 在你沒打算投擲汽油彈前不要點燃。因為汽油彈不只丟擲出去有作用，要是你不小心掉在地上的話，你就糟了。
[Don't relax after killing a giant worm.  Little bits of them can break off and still attack!] 殺了巨蟲也不要鬆懈。某些巨蟲能夠分裂並繼續攻擊！
[Don't try to take on a skeleton with a bladed weapon... you'll just leave scratch marks.  You've got to shatter those bones with a hammer or something.] 別試著用刀劍之類的砍劈武器來攻擊骷髏怪... 你只能對他們造成刮痕。你必須用類似鎚子的鈍擊武器來把他們敲成碎片。
[Don't underestimate a good book.  Not only will it keep you company on lonely nights, but you can learn a hell of a lot from some of them.] 不要小看一本好書。它不僅能陪伴你度過寂寞的夜晚，而且某些書還能讓你學到超多的好東西。
[Don't use Molotovs indoors.  Especially in a liquor store.] 不要在室內使用汽油彈。尤其是在酒類專賣店。
[Ever go toe-to-toe with a manhack?  Tiny little helicopters covered in knives.  Best be packing a shotgun!] 絕對不要肉搏鋸鳥！他們是小小的直升機卻裝滿了刀子。用散彈槍把他擊落吧！
[Ever run into those big worm things?  If you see trails of churned-up dirt, you can be sure they're around.] 有看過巨大的蟲嗎？若是你在附近有看到黏液的軌跡，那麼肯定在附近。

[Have you heard about those queen triffids?  You gotta keep your distance from them, unless you like having a tree grow right through your chest.] 你有聽過王后食人樹嗎？你最好跟他們保持距離，除非你想要胸膛被樹刺穿。
[Have you seen those eyebots flying around?  It's hard to say, but some faction's controlling them--maybe the military.  All I know is, I don't want them taking my picture...] 你有沒有看過飛行中的眼球機器人？我不確定是不是有某些派系在控制--也許是軍隊。我所知道的，就是不要讓他們照我相片。
[Have you seen those weird science labs out in the middle of nowhere?  I think you need some kind of special ID card to get in.] 你有看過那些出現在奇怪位置的實驗室嗎？我看你要拿到一些特殊的ID卡才能進入。

Then duck out the back door, and watch the zombies run into a burning building!] 教你個搞定殭屍海的技巧:跑到酒類專賣店，盡可能多打破一些瓶子，然後把酒點燃。接著就躲到後門去，等著看殭屍跑到火燒屋送死！
[Houses can be a surprisingly good resource for all kinds of stuff; clothing, medication, food, books, and more.] 房屋裡有各種出乎意料的物資；衣物、藥品、食物、書籍等等。
[Hunting rifles are great at long range, but suck close up.  Plus, most of them don't carry many rounds.  Keep a pistol as a sidearm if you use a rifle.] 來福獵槍是長程攻擊的利器，但是近距離可說是廢物。此外，大部分都沒有高容量彈匣。所以若是你要用的話，最好帶把副武器類似手槍來當做副武器。
[I figured out how to take care of those triffids!  Let me just say this: they're made of wood, and wood and fire don't mix.] 我知道怎麼對付這些食人樹了！我就這麼說吧：他們是木質的，乾柴烈火。
[I have a buddy who was sleeping in this cabin way out in the woods, when he suddenly woke up to trees and vines growing right up through the floor and walls!  He said it was some kind of huge triffid making it happen...] 我有個朋友在遠離塵囂的森林小屋中睡覺時，他突然醒來發現樹與籐蔓生長刺穿了地板與牆壁！他說這是某種巨大的食人樹造成的...
[I heard about this group that raided a bee hive a while ago.  Everyone got massacred but one, and he came home with this weird, magic honey stuff.] 我聽說不久前有隊人馬有去劫掠蜂巢。結果最後只剩下一個人活著回家，還帶著一種類似蜂蜜的奇特東西。
[I know grocery stores and stuff are full of fruit, but be careful, it's probably rotten.] 我知道雜貨店有很多水果，但是有可能是腐爛掉的。
[I know it's tempting to just go full-auto and unload as many bullets as possible, but don't except as a last resort.  It's inaccurate and wastes ammo.] 我知道槍械開連發來狂射子彈是很爽的，但是盡量當做最後的手段使用。因為命中率不高而且浪費子彈。
[I know they look dumb, but wearing a fanny pack gives you that extra bit of storage without encumbering you.] 我知道看起來很土，但是戴個腰包能夠讓你有額外的儲物空間而且又不會造成累贅。
[I once knew a guy who figured he'd survive a night in the subway by setting fires blocking off the tunnel in both directions and sleeping between them.  He wound up asphyxiating on the smoke.] 我知道有某個天才想到了為了安全的在地下鐵過夜，所以生了火在通道口兩方，而自己睡在中間。結果他最後因為煙塵窒息而死。
[I've found more good weapons in hardware stores than anywhere else.  Except gun stores, of course.] 我在五金行找到比其他地方更多的好武器。當然要是找到槍械商店就更好了。
[I've seen a couple guys running around with laser pistols.  They seem like the perfect weapon... quiet, accurate, and deadly.  But I've never found one, and I bet ammo is wicked scarce...] 我曾看過有人拿過雷射手槍。看起來好像是完美的武器... 安靜，準確，又致命。但是我從來就沒拿到過，而且我猜彈藥一定很稀少...
[I've spent many nights in the changing rooms at the back of clothing stores.  Walls on four sides, far from the store's entrance, a corridor for easy defense... it's perfect!] 我曾在服飾店的更衣間安然度過好幾個夜晚。四面都有牆、遠離店門口、易於防守的狹窄走廊... 真完美！
[I've thought about raiding an ant hill before, but I realized it wasn't worth the risk.  I doubt they have any loot beyond some scraps of food, you know?] 我之前有想到要劫掠蟻穴，但是我意識到不值得冒這個險。我想那邊應該不會有什麼值得拿的東西，懂嗎？
[If there's a bunch of zombies in a straight line, try unloading a burst from your gun.  Be sure to aim at the zombie furthest away; you'll hit more of them that way.] 要是有一群殭屍在一直線上，試著使用槍械的連發模式來射擊。利用瞄準最遠的一隻殭屍，來達到掃射其他殭屍的效果。
[If there's a pool of acid blocking your way, trying tossing a junk item into it.  Eating up items will help neutralize the acid faster.] 假如有一灘酸液擋住你的去路，試著丟個垃圾物品上去。酸蝕物品會讓酸液中和速度加快。
[If you can spare the space, you might want to carry a fire extinguisher along.  Nothing is worse than being trapped in a burning building!] 假如你能騰出空間，你也許會想帶支滅火器。被困在失火中的建築是很糟糕的。
[If you get a pair of night vision goggles, hold on to them!  A flashlight will give you away, but with goggles you can be sneaky.] 要是你拿到夜視鏡，好好留著！手電筒會暴露你的位置，夜視鏡卻能讓你潛行。
[If you need a bunch of rags for making Molotov cocktails, take a pair of scissors to an old t-shirt or something.] 假如你需要一些布條來做汽油彈，帶著剪刀跟舊T恤之類的就行了。
[If you need to, you can swim across a river to escape; most monsters can't swim.  Just make sure you drop as much stuff as possible first, and maybe strip naked, or you'll sink like a rock.] 假使有必要的話，你可以利用游泳過河來脫逃；大部分的怪物都不會游泳。只是要先確認你東西沒有帶太多，或乾脆直接脫光光，不然你會立刻像石頭沉到水裡。
[If you run into a zombie hulk, it's probably a good idea to run.  They're fast as hell, but pretty dumb; they'll try to smash through obstacles rather than going around, and that slows them down a lot.] 要是你被殭屍浩克發現，你最好是快逃。他的速度雖然很快，但是很笨；他們追擊時會砸爛擋路的所有東西，反而會讓他們速度減緩很多。
[If you see a big mob of zombies coming, RUN!  Trying to fight them all is suicide unless you have a big tactical advantage.] 要是你看到一大群的殭屍接近，快逃！若是你沒有戰術優勢的話，想要挑戰全部的殭屍根本是自殺。
[If you shoot a zombie, but don't quite kill it, try to finish it off with a punch or something instead of wasting a bullet.] 假如你射中了殭屍，但是還沒殺掉，可以試著用拳頭或是其他不浪費彈藥的方法來結束它。
[If you're getting chased by a hoard of zombies, try ducking into the subways and traveling a block or two, then coming back up.] 假如你被殭屍海追，試著躲到地下鐵並走了一兩步，然後再回到地面。
[If you're going to be playing with Molotov cocktails around a gas station, just make sure you're a long way from those pumps.] 假如你打算在加油站附近玩汽油彈，先確定你離汽油泵夠遠。
[If you're in a corridor or something, and there's a bunch of zombies chasing you down it, try to wound the guy in front badly.  He'll start moving slow and cause a serious traffic jam!] 若是你在狹窄的走廊之類的地方，而有一大堆殭屍在追你，試著把最前面一隻打成重傷。它的移動速度會降低而造成後方交通阻塞！
[If you're planning on wandering around the sewers--not that you'd have a reason too--watch out for those fish.  Those suckers are fast, and vicious too!] 要是你打算到下水道晃--你最好有個原因再去--小心那些魚。那個混蛋游很快，而且也有毒！
[If you're spending the night in a dangerous area, grab a shovel and dig pits all around your camp.] 若是你在危險的地方過夜，帶把鏟子把你的營地的四周挖坑吧。
[If you're wandering in the wilderness, or following a road, keep an eye out for wild strawberries or blueberries.] 如果你在荒野上漫遊，或是沿著公路時，可以看看有沒有野生草莓或藍莓可以撿。
[If you're weak or clumsy, it might be a good idea not to mess with Molotovs or grenades.  Accidentally dropping them when you meant to throw them could be deadly.] 要是你力氣不大或是很笨拙，你最好不要亂玩汽油彈或是手榴彈。想投擲出去卻不小心掉到地上會害死自己。
[In a lot of places, there's little hallways connecting the subways with the sewers, with heavy metal doors on both ends.  It's a perfect place to sleep!] 在許多地點，有著狹窄的走廊，連接了地下鐵與下水道，兩端都是沈重的金屬門。是睡覺的好地點！
[It's a good idea to butcher corpses if you have the time, even if you don't plan on eating them.  I've seen these weird zombies bring their friends back from the dead!] 當你有時間時，屠宰屍體是個好主意，就算你沒有要去吃他們。我就見過這些詭異的殭屍把他們倒地的同伴又喚醒了！
[It's a good idea to carry around a couple of empty bottles.  You can fill them up with water, gasoline, or whatever!] 隨身帶數個空瓶子很好用。你可以用來裝水、汽油、之類的東西！
[It's good to keep a filter mask or gas mask handy.  You never know when you'll have to go into a smoke-filled room or something.] 身上最好帶著過濾面罩或是防毒面具。你永遠不知道何時你會需要進入滿是煙霧的房間之類的環境。
[It's good to keep a pistol handy, in case your main gun runs out of ammo or something.  They're also better than most guns at short range.] 為了防止主武器用完子彈之類的問題，最好還是帶把手槍。手槍在近距離的能力還是比大部分的槍好。
[It's not like in the movies--shooting a gas pump won't make it explode.  But it WILL make it leak all over the place, which is a definite fire hazard.] 不像電影--射擊汽油泵並不會爆炸。只會讓汽油流的到處都是，容易造成火災。
[Liquor stores are a great place to pick up non-alcoholic beverages, too.  Not that I mind alcohol!] 酒類專賣店也是個拿非酒類飲料的好地方。雖然我也不介意拿點酒啦！
[Most gun stores follow pretty similar layouts.  The restricted stuff--SMGs, assault rifles, and most importantly ammo--are always behind the counter.] 大部分的槍械商店有著類似的佈置。一些受管制的東西--衝鋒槍，突擊步槍，和最重要的彈藥--通常都放在櫃檯後方。
[Next time you visit a grocery store, load up on canned goods.  They never go bad!] 下次你拜訪雜貨店的時候，拿些罐頭吧。不會腐敗喔！
[Oh man, have you gone down into the old subway systems?  I'd be careful... there's these things down there that are like zombies, but tougher.] 兄弟，你有沒有下去過舊的地下鐵系統？我會很小心... 那裡有一些類似殭屍的東西，但是更強。
[Shotguns are nice; you can take out lots of baddies with a single shot.  Just remember that they're noisy as hell, and you might end up attracting more than you kill.] 散彈槍很讚；你能用一槍就幹掉一群壞東西。只是要記得這東西會產生很大的噪音，可能會引來更多殺不完的怪物。
[Skeletons are a tough target.  They're so skinny and full of holes that bullets fired at them will usually just fly right past.] 骷髏怪是很難搞的目標。他們很瘦並且佈滿孔洞，所以子彈常常打不中。
[Skeletons are too delicate to smash through doors or windows.  They also can't smell you, unlike zombies, so if you turn your light off at night you can sneak right past.] 骷髏怪太柔弱所以砸不開門窗。他們也不能聞到你的氣味，不像一般的殭屍一樣，所以你在夜晚時把燈關上就能夠繞過去。
[Ski goggles are a great choice if you're worried about getting stuff in your eyes.  Perfect for dealing with boomers!] 滑雪護目鏡是你擔心眼睛中招的好選擇。對付嘔吐者非常好用。
[Sledge hammers may seem like a great weapon, but swinging them is really slow, and you won't do much damage unless you're really strong.] 大鎚看起好像很強，但是揮舞起來卻很慢，而且你要是不夠強壯的話也無法造成太多傷害。
[Smoke grenades aren't really offensive weapons, but they'll cover up your scent and hide you from view--perfect for making a quick escape.] 煙霧彈並不是用來進攻的武器，但是能夠用來掩護你避免被看見--是完美的快速脫逃工具。
[Squirrels are pretty yummy, but if you shoot them with a high-powered gun you'll probably be left with no meat!  Use a BB gun or maybe a .22 rifle.] 松鼠很好吃，但是如果你用高傷害的槍械來攻擊他們的話，大概什麼都不留了！用BB槍或是.22口徑步槍吧。
[Standing behind a window is a good tactic.  It takes zombies a long time to crawl through, giving you lots of opportunities to hit them.] 站在窗戶後是很好的戰略。殭屍爬窗很花時間，讓你有很大的機率擊中他們。
[There's basically no reason not to wear safety glasses... nothing is worse than taking a hit to the eyes and getting blinded for a few seconds.] 基本上沒有不戴護目鏡的理由... 沒有什麼比被擊中眼睛造成失明更慘的了。
[There's snakes down in most of the old sewer systems.  They're slow on land, but boy, those suckers can swim fast!] 大部分的舊下水道系統都有蛇。他們在陸地上走很慢，但是，這些混蛋游泳游的很快！
[There's this type of zombie that can shoot bolts of lightning!  Stay away from walls and stuff when they do... the electricity can travel along solid surfaces.] 還有殭屍是能夠發射閃電的！離牆壁或其他物品遠點... 因為電能夠透過其他固體傳導。
[They're rare, but molebots are nasty things.  They bore through the ground, then pop up to stab ya.  Still, you're safe from them if you stay on pavement...] 雖然很少遇到，但是地鼠機器人很討厭。它們能夠鑽入地底，然後衝出地表來刺你。當然，你待在硬路面就安全了...
[This guy I know was walking through the subway when he came across a giant rift in the earth, with lava far below.  Weird, huh?] 我認識有一個人曾經去過地下鐵然後遇到地面有個大裂縫，地底居然有岩漿。很詭異吧？
[Those acid-spitting zombies are pretty nasty, but if you're smart, you can get other zombies to wade through the acid.] 那些會噴酸液的殭屍非常討厭，但是如果你夠聰明的話，可以利用來殺傷其他殭屍。
[Triffids are tough.  They've got natural armor, and it takes a lot to bring them down.  I don't recommend getting into a fight with them.] 食人樹很強。他們有天然的護甲，所以要付出更多代價才能打倒。我不建議跟他們對戰。
[Triffids can't see!  They figure out where you are by your smell, but if you mask it with smoke or something, you're as good as invisible.] 食人樹看不見！他們是利用嗅覺來判斷你的方位，但是你若使用煙霧彈或是一些東西就能夠遮蔽，你就等於是隱形了。
[Try not to kill a boomer if it's standing right next to you.  They tend to explode when they die, and that pink goop will get all over you.] 試著不要殺掉站在你旁邊的嘔吐者。他們會在死掉時爆炸，讓你被粉紅黏液噴的滿身都是。
[Try to go around swamps, if you can.  Some of them have sinkholes that can pull you right underground.] 試著繞過沼澤。某些沼澤中有陷落坑，會把你拉到地底。
[Try to stay on the roads as much as you can.  Giant worms can't cross them!] 試著盡量走在馬路上，因為巨蟲沒有辦法穿過馬路！
[Watch out for those zombies that shriek; they'll let other zombies know where you are, and will attract them from all over.] 小心會尖叫的殭屍；他們會讓其他殭屍知道你在哪，並且會從四面八方吸引過來。
[When it comes to footwear, you've got two basic choices as far as I see it; sneakers, for running extra fast, or boots for durability.  Depends on your style, I guess.] 說到腳上穿的，我目前知道你有兩種基本的選擇；運動鞋，能夠跑的更快，或是靴子，更耐用。端看你想要走哪種路線。
[While there's not much to loot, gas stations are a good source for gasoline, to power tools or to make Molotov cocktails.] 雖然不多，但加油站是汽油的好來源，能夠讓動力工具或汽油彈工作。
[You don't really need to wear gloves most of the time, but once in a while they'll really come in handy.] 大部分的時候你並不一定要戴手套，但是有需要時很有用。
[You know what makes a nice weapon?  Take a two by four, or a baseball bat or something, and stick a bunch of nails through the end!] 你知道好武器怎麼做的嗎？拿個 2x4 木材，棒球棍或是其他的，並加上一盒釘子釘在尾端！
[You know, a glass bottle can make a good weapon in a pinch.  If you break it over someone's head, the shattering glass will hurt them extra.  Of course, it might hurt your hands, too...] 你知道嗎，玻璃瓶也能夠當做一個很好的近戰武器。若是你拿去敲某人的頭，玻璃破片會造成額外的傷害。當然，也可能會傷到你的手掌...
[You know, you don't have to go full auto with an assault rifle.  Firing single shots is more accurate and efficient!] 你知道嗎，你拿突擊步槍不一定就要開連發。單發射擊的命中率更高，更有效率！
[Zombie brutes and hulks have really tough hide.  Don't bother shooting at them with lower-caliber guns, the bullet will bounce right off!] 殭屍獸與殭屍浩克有很堅硬的外皮。用小口徑的槍械射擊是沒多大作用的，子彈會被彈開！
[Zombie hulks are NASTY, but they're easy to outsmart.  If there's other monsters between you and them, they'll kill the monster for you!] 殭屍浩克很可怕，但是你能夠智取。若是有其他怪物擋在你跟他之間，他會幫你把其他怪物殺掉！
[Zombies are pretty dumb... heck, most monsters are!  If you can get a fire going between you and them, they'll just run straight through it.] 殭屍是非常笨的... 嘿，大部分的怪物也是！若是你能夠在你和怪物中生火，他們就只會直直的衝入火海中。

[A post-mortem on the rat involved in the electrocution incident has revealed several changes to its internal anatomy centered around its connection with the monitoring device, and large buildups of XE037 were detected around the connection point.] 對於老鼠進行的驗屍發現了一些變化，它的內部結構與監視儀器包在一起並連結，並在連結處檢驗出了大量的XE037累積。
[After our curious results with testing XE037 on non-human mammals, we decided to introduce the substance to some of the insects which have found their way into the lab.  Horrifyingly, XE037 caused near-instant mutation and gigantism in the insects, and security intervention was required.] 在我們好奇對非人類哺乳動物測試XE037之後，我們決定對一些跑到實驗室的昆蟲來測試。可怕的是，XE037立即讓這些昆蟲產生了巨大化突變，只好進行安全干預。
[An alarming discovery has been made.  A colony of XE037 has formed nearly a half mile from the laboratory.  It is unclear how it escaped; it is quite possible that it is in the ground water now.] 發生一件緊急的狀況。在離實驗區域半英哩遠的地方出現XE037病菌。目前尚不知如何洩漏；看來很有可能已經存在於地下水了。
[An emergency meeting was held today to discuss the possible implications of widespread XE037 contamination.  It was agreed that neutralization must be instated immediately to prevent a catastrophic event.] 今天召開緊急會議，討論XE037污染擴散的可能影響。與會者一致認為，必須立即執行中和復原，以防止災難性事件。
[An incident occurred in the teleportation lab, wherein a subject managed to teleport into another subject.  The latter was completely destroyed from the inside out, while the former sustained little damage.  I would like to explore the phenomenon further, but subjects are expensive.] 在傳送實驗室發生了一件意外，某個測試對象傳送到另一個測試對象的位置時，後者會被完全摧毀，而前者只會受到一點點損傷。我想要針對這狀況再做更多實驗，但是測試對象太昂貴了。
[As in the tests of isolated XE037 samples, prolonged radiation exposure of T3D has resulted in significant structural changes.  These do not appear to be random.  T3D appears to be in immense pain as a result of these changes, but the lack of an oral opening has rendered him unable to vocalize.] 在XE037的隔離測試中，T3D受到長期照射導致顯著的結構性變化。這狀況不是隨機的。T3D顯現出了對於變異極大的痛苦，由於變異的因素，讓他缺少了開放的口腔能夠發聲。
[Attempts to surpass the XE037 mammalian stasis limit have had some success.  Direct subcutaneous injection of XE037 quickly spreads through the body, and while it immediately enters stasis after equalizing, it remains in the body.] 試圖將XE037用於非哺乳類的研究已經有了一些進展。若直接將XE037進行皮下注射，待循環擴散到全身之後，便會留存在體內潛伏。
[Both PE012 and PE018 show great stability.  A subject was exposed to both substances, alternating between the mutagen and the purifier.  Ultimately, the subject returned to baseline state with no apparent side effects.] PE012和PE018都表現出極大的穩定性。某個樣本同時用了這兩個物質，在突變劑與淨化劑中切換。最終，樣本回歸到基本狀態並且沒有顯現出任何的副作用。
[Catastrophe struck in our teleportation department yesterday.  It seems that our test subjects are so detached from this plane that they create occasional tunnels along the 4th dimension, allowing life forms to transfer to this plane.  All subjects with prolonged exposure have been terminated.] 昨天我們的傳送部門出現災難。我們的測試對象在測試機上會出現偶然的四維空間通道，以致於無法固定樣本在測試機上，並且會讓生命體傳送到測試機中。所有照射過的測試對象都被終結了。
[Despite a wide variety of treatments, we have been completely unsuccessful in removing XE037 from human subjects.  Every individual displayed revivification post termination.  Interestingly, XE037 seems to be completely inert prior to termination.] 儘管已經嘗試過各種治療方法，我們仍然無法成功的把XE037從人類測試對象中移除。每個個體都在終結後復活了。有趣的是，XE037似乎在測試對象被終結前都是呈現潛伏狀態。
[Dr. Dionne's team has come up with an ambitious mutagenic cocktail, dubbed PE065.  Though its effects are wildly polymorphic and unstable, to say the least, he suggests that several such mutants could effectively check the spread of reanimated XE037 infectees.  We are looking into implementation methodology.] Dionne博士的團隊已經想出了一種很有野心的綜合突變劑，也就是PE065。儘管影響很廣泛並且不穩定，但是至少，他建議利用這類的突變體能夠有效的檢查XE037型感染。我們正在研究可行的方法。
[Dr. Maiar has been terminated for engaging in unethical research on human subjects.  His notes are being destroyed and all personnel under him have been reassigned.  Further discussion of or attempts to carry on his work will be grounds for immediate termination.] Maiar博士已經被終止從事對人體進行非人道的研究。他的筆記已被銷燬，在他團隊的所有人員已被重新指派。進一步討論或企圖繼續他的研究工作將會被立即解雇。
[Dr. Maiar's success with intravenous mutagenic administration has been adopted facility-wide; insofar as any of our work can ever be 'published', he and his team hit the jackpot.  IV administration is quicker and easier, and in some cases is reportedly more efficient, than the oral techniques we have been using.] Maiar博士的靜脈注射突變方式已經成功運用在大量設施；目前我們的工作都還完全不能被'公開'，他與他的團隊中大獎了。靜脈注射方式簡單又快，比我們以前的口服方式更有效率。
[Earlier conjecture that revivification occurred only in humans and insects was premature.  Exposure introduces a persistent, low level infection in all mammal subjects, but quickly enters a form of stasis and seems to go dormant.] 先前臆測復活只發生在人類和昆蟲是不成熟的。照射之後所有的哺乳類對象會造成一種永久性的輕微感染，但是很快地就會進入了潛伏形式。
[Exposure of large quantities of XE037 to various types of radiation have shown promising results, stimulating activity and forming interesting structural changes in the subject being tested.  Exposure to radiation on living subjects scheduled.] 照射大量的XE037於許多不同種類的放射線產生了新的結果，測試對象會產生許多有趣的結構與刺激活性。照射放射線於活體測試對象的排程。
[Exposure to radiation of test subject T3D indicates stimulation of internal XE037 deposits and a temporary lifting of the mammalian stasis condition.] 照射了放射線的T3D測試對象顯示了，內部的XE037殘留會暫時解除哺乳類的潛伏狀況。
[General Carlsberg wanted us to figure out what's going on with the bot AI.  Apparently the fat-cat defense contractors' toy tank has ranging issues or something: 31-34 meters and it's apparently impotent.  The Director sent 'em back with a note that we're scientists, not firmware devs.] 卡士伯將軍要我們找出這隻機器人的人工智慧發生什麼事。很明顯的，這是某個黑心防禦工事承包商的玩具坦克捅出來的婁子。在線路第31到第34公尺的地方出了問題，那個地方顯然很重要。監督者把屬下都叫回去了，並留下了一張紙條，上面說「我們是科學家，不是軟體工程師！」
[Given the current population projections, PE065 deployment is no longer feasible.  We simply haven't the stock.  Remaining chemical and psychopharmacological department assets are being assigned to Dr. Sattler's PE070 project.] 鑑於目前的人口推算，PE065的佈署已不再可行。我們就是沒那麼多庫存。剩餘的化學品與精神藥物將會重新分配到 Sattler 博士的PE070計畫之中。
[I don't know how it happened, but a janitor managed to activate the portal while cleaning the lab, shifting in an assortment of prehistoric fauna.  Security was called in immediately but was unable to save the janitor from being torn apart.  By the time the confusion settled, all the fauna had been terminated.] 我不知道這是怎麼發生的，清潔工在清理實驗室時啟動了傳送器，結果傳送來了一種史前動物。保全隨即趕到現場，但是沒有辦法救到已經被撕成碎片的清潔工。在一陣混亂之後，所有的史前生物都被終結了。
[I swear they are talking to me.  No one believes me.  No one understands.  They whisper to me, at night, in the dark.  Please, please, make them stop.] 我發誓他們有對我說話。沒有人相信我。沒有人了解。他們在夜晚，在黑暗中對我低語。拜託，拜託，叫他們停。
[Incidence of post-mortem mutation seems to depend on several factors - leading candidates include type and amount of damage sustained leading to expiration, embedded foreign bodies at time of revivification, proximity to other revived individuals, and the body mass of the subject.] 屍體突變的發生機率似乎取決於幾個因素 - 主要是致命傷的種類與傷害量，嵌入的異物，與其他復活個體的距離，以及測試對象的重量。
[It has begun.  The XE037 contamination has spread for miles, and those who have since deceased have revivified.  It is my fear that extremely large populations will be decimated by this pandemic.  We must find a way to remove XE037 from revivified bodies.] 開始了。XE037的汙染已經蔓延了數英里，死者復甦。我擔心會有極大量的人口會被這種傳染病破壞殆盡。我們必須找到能從已復甦的人體移除XE037的方法。
[Jakobson insists that S37ZBE must continue, despite the extreme security and safety risks.  Nearly half of our security forces have been redirected to the S37ZBE project, simply to deal with the occasional escape of a subject.] 雅各布堅持S37ZBE的項目必須繼續，儘管有著極端的安全風險。近半的保全部隊都被重新分配到了S37ZBE計畫項目，只是為了防止測試對象的逃脫。
[Jakobson was killed today by one of S37ZBE's subjects; ironic considering how hard he fought to keep the project active.  Alarmingly, his corpse revivified immediately.  This suggests that XE037 may have contaminated the lab at large.] 雅各布今天早上被其中一個S37ZBE計畫的測試對象殺害了；諷刺的是，正是他努力地要讓此計畫繼續。令人擔心的是，他的遺體立刻復活了。這代表XE037可能已經污染了實驗室。
[Mendelson has been terminated following an incident with XE037.  A substantial mobile sample departed his lab and encountered our security forces.  Before the sample was destroyed, it managed to kill two men.  Alarmingly, their corpses displayed mobility and extreme aggression.] 曼德森已經被終止接觸以下與XE037的有關事件。大量的樣本離開了他的實驗室，並且與我們的保全武力接戰。在所有的樣本被摧毀前，我們有兩位人員被殺死。令人擔心的是，他們的屍體出現了活動性與極端的攻擊性。
[Mendelson shows a dismaying lack of organization and security consciousness.  Containment of all samples of XE037 is of critical importance, as shown by contamination experiments.] 曼德森出現缺乏管理與安全意識的狀況。管制XE037樣本是至關重要的，就像受污染實驗所顯示的結果。
[Our chemical department has made great strides in the production of a concentrated mutagen, derived from samples of PE012.] 從PE012的樣本得出，我們的化學部門對於量產中的突變劑研發有長足的進步。
[Our chemical department has perfected an untargeted stem cell treatment.  Consumption of the treatment will reverse the effects of mutation, and may even cure congenital defects.  This substance has been denoted PE018.] 我們的化學部門已經完善了無針對性的幹細胞治療法。能夠回復突變的影響，甚至可能治癒先天性缺陷。此物質已被記錄在PE018報告。
[Our cloning department has failed to produce results.  In vats containing stem cell treatments, XE037, and control vats, the subjects simple disintegrated.  This suggests that XE037, while compatible with subprime lifeforms, shows only destructive effects on prime plane lifeforms.] 我們的複製部門無法產生實驗結果。在裝有幹細胞治療樣本XE037的大桶，與控制組的大桶，測試對象就簡單的崩解了。這表示了當XE037與次級生命體相容時，將會對主生命體產生毀滅性的影響。
[Our lifeform extraction program continues to produce samples of specimen XE037.  It seems to be a kind of living, semi-sentient primordial ooze, and is the basis of much of the life we have found.] 我們的生命體萃取程式持續的生產樣本XE037。這似乎是一種有生命、半意識的原始軟泥，也是我們找到的大多數生命的基礎。
[Our research on teleportation has ground to a halt.  For some reason, the creation of a long-range transportation device eludes us, and one can transfer no further than 30 meters.] 我們對於傳送裝置的研究陷入了瓶頸。因為某種因素，我們無法製造出長程傳送的裝置，因此目前人體的傳送距離最多只能達到30公尺。
[Our security department has identified several key flaws.  Though our surface entrance is quite secure, there are several possible points of entry below the surface, particularly in the sewage systems.] 我們的保全部門已經找到了一些關鍵的漏洞。雖然我們的入口表面是相當安全的，但是在地表下有數個可能的滲透點，特別是下水道系統。
[PE062, our "cure" for XE037 contamination, has neared perfection.  Sadly, the production of PE062 is a costly and time-consuming process.  What is more, the substance shows no effect on postmortem subjects whatsoever; a substance which renders XE037 inert after it has activated would be immensely useful in the case of an outbreak.] PE062，我們對於XE037的解藥，已經接近完美了。可惜的是，製作PE062的過程耗費大量金錢與時間成本。並且在已死亡的測試對象上沒有效果；只有在XE037還在潛伏狀態時才能阻止發作。
[Post-mortem revivification of subject T3D occurred as expected, followed by an immediate autopsy.  The internal changes were significant, with large parts of the subjects internal anatomy replaced with "organs" of XE037 with unknown properties, primarily those known to succumb earlier to the effects of radiation poisoning.] 測試對象T3D的復活作用如預期，於是立刻進行屍檢。其內部結構變化之大，以致於大部分都變成了XE037與未知物體的內臟，已知的主要原因是放射線中毒。
[Program S37ZBE, investigation of XE037 on inert human bodies, is making great strides.  Recently we found that XE037 has no effect when introduced to a deceased body; revivification only occurs when the subject is exposed to XE037 prior to expiration.] 程序S37ZBE，研究 XE037 對於惰性人體的影響有了極大的進展。最近我們發現XE037用於已經死亡的個體不會有任何效果；復活作用只有在個體尚存活前有照射到之後才有效果。
[Recent fieldwork and extraction efforts have resulted in a series of mutagens tailored to focus the mutation process into particular subtypes.  These have been designated PE025 through 037.  Though significantly more resource- and time-intensive to produce, they promise a bold new transhuman future.  Several research teams are already investigating possible applications.] 經過最近的實地工作和萃取的努力結果，已能夠做出一系列特定子類型的突變劑。這些已編號成 PE025 到 037。有著大量的資源與時間能夠大量生產，並保證了形成超人類的未來。數個研究團隊已經開始研究可能的應用方式。
[S37ZBE may be put on indefinite hold shortly.  Postmortem morphological changes have reached extreme levels; this morning one subject nearly doubled in size, acquiring enough strength to reduce a concrete wall to rubble.  It required a 6 man team, heavily armed, to re-terminate the subject.] S37ZBE不久後可能會被無限期擱置。死後型態的變化已經達到了極限等級；今天早上一個測試對象已增長到接近兩倍的體積，有足夠的力量把混凝土牆化為瓦礫。需要用到六個人搭配重型火力，才能重新終結測試對象。
[S37ZBE, the special investigation into the effects of XE037 on inert human bodies, has made terrific discoveries.  It seems that it occasionally displays a mutagenic property which manifests itself after termination of the subject, resulting in a striking variety in postmortem morphology.] 特殊調查S37ZBE：XE037對惰性人體的影響，獲得了極大的發現。似乎在已終結的測試對象上偶爾會出現突變的狀況，產生出多種不同的死後型態。
[Samples of XE037 from subject T3D remains extremely active.  Further experimentation on induced mutation in infected individuals shows significant potential.  Samples of the enhanced XE037, labeled PE012, have been sent to several researchers for further study.] 於測試對象T3D採集的XE037樣本依然有相當高的活性。在受感染的個體誘發突變的實驗有了進一步的潛力。強化的XE037樣本，被標註為 PE012，已被送給數個研究員進行進一步研究。
[Several of the more advanced specimens we have retrieved show stunning similarity to XE037.  XE142 and XE157 in particular show the same amorphous, slime-like structure as XE037, suggesting a close genetic relationship.] 幾個我們已經發展出的進階樣本顯示出與XE037驚異的相似度。XE142 與 XE157 ，特別是與XE037出現相同的無定形結構，代表有近親的基因關係。
[Specimen XE037, jokingly referred to as "the blob", has been observed entering a kind of dormant state, forming a depression in the floor.  Hendelson stepped into one of these pits yesterday, and was immediately coated and attacked.] 樣本XE037，被戲稱為"黏球怪"，已被觀察到進入了一種休眠狀態，在地板上形成水坑狀態。昨天韓德森踩到其中一個水坑，就立刻被包覆攻擊。
[Subject T3D has succumbed to radiation poisoning, but not before undergoing several more physiological changes the lab boys are referring to as "mutations".  They do not appear to be truly random, and may be an attempt by XE037 to adapt its host to an unknown stimulus.] 測試對象T3D最後死於放射線中毒，但在此之前經歷了幾個生理變化，實驗室的男生指的是“基因突變”。但是並不是隨機的突變，而像是XE037試著要與未知的外來刺激進行寄生。
[Termination of a subject which was never a part of S37ZBE has confirmed my fears.  XE037 has contaminated most, if not all of the laboratory, most likely via the water supply.  Research has started immediately into a process to destroy XE037 within the human body.] 一個從未接觸過S37ZBE的已終結測試對象，證實了我的恐懼。XE037似乎已經透過了供水系統污染了大部分的實驗區域。研究銷燬人體內的XE037的計畫已經開始。
[Test subjects in the teleportation department are showing alarming symptoms.  It seems prolonged rapid transposition along the 4th dimension weakens the forces holding one on this plane.] 在傳送部門的測試對象都出現了令人擔憂的症狀。長期進行多次在四維空間的傳送似乎會削弱將其固定在測試機的力量。
[Testing XE037 on non-human mammal subjects does not appear to display the same revivifying effect, oddly enough.  Acquiring non-human subjects, sadly, is a long and costly process, and research into this area is lacking.] 在非人類的哺乳類測試對象上使用XE037不會出現相同的復活現象，非常奇怪。不幸的是，取得非人類測試對象，是漫長且昂貴的過程，所以在這領域的研究上非常缺乏。
[Tests on the prehistoric fauna show extremely close genetic relationships with extant and extinct terranean animals.  It might be that the portal had performed a transposition in time, unfortunately the portal device was destroyed when security put down the fauna.] 測試這些史前生物的基因結果顯示與地表現存與已滅絕的動物有近親關係。有可能是傳送門擾亂了時間順序，不幸的是，傳送裝置在保全把史前生物撂倒時一併摧毀了。
[The chemical department has come through with a stable mutagen cocktail.  PE050 shows promise as an all-around genetic enhancement, with the worst side effect being digestive upset.  The lack of macro-scale physical changes makes it ideal for both military and civilian applications.] 化學部門調配出了一種穩定的混合突變劑。PE050有希望成為一個全能的基因改良樣本，最糟的副作用是消化不良。但是長遠來看這些變化將會適合在軍用與民用領域。
[The primary factor in determining revivification of mammalian subjects seems to be the amount of XE037 within the body at time of expiration.  Smaller mammals such as lab rats do not obtain this critical mass of XE037 before going dormant.  Larger canine subjects, however, do.] 檢定哺乳類測試對象復活作用的主要因素似乎與體內XE037的劑量與經過時間有關。像是實驗室老鼠這種較小的哺乳類，在反應衰竭前不會有XE037的變異反應。大型的犬科測試對象就會。
[The research team headed by Dr. Isha has produced a concentrated form of mutagen that shows promising results for the treatment of many forms of disease.  Testing reveals that it inhibits the body's pain responses while bolstering the immune system and natural regenerative capabilities, though a few troubling behavioral side effects have been reported.] 以Isha博士為首的研究小組已經生產出濃縮形式的突變劑，可望能治癒多種身體疾病。測試表明，它能夠抑制人體的疼痛反應並強化免疫系統和自然再生能力，但也有一些令人不安的行為副作用。
[The vivisection program has shown mixed results, revealing an incredible degree of variation in subplane lifeforms.  Certain specimens have an internal structure that is amazingly similar to that of mammals, while others seem to have no internal structure at all.] 活體解剖程序顯示了不同的結果，顯示出了子空間生命體令人震驚的構造。某些樣本有著與哺乳類動物相同的構造，而有些則根本沒有任何內部構造。
[There has been an incident in Lab 24, 2 casualties reported, one lethal.  A rat involved in the stasis breaking project was hooked to a monitoring machine and left over night.  Upon opening the cage, Simon Bellevue was electrocuted, and another researcher at the opposite end of the lab sustained severe current burns, despite never approaching the cage.] 在24號實驗室發生一起兩人受傷的致命性事故。一隻在進行破潛伏專案的老鼠被掛在監視儀器前一整晚。在打開籠子的時候，賽門貝爾維觸電了，在實驗室另一端的研究員也受到嚴重的持續灼傷，儘管他完全沒有靠近籠子。
[There is a belief several other rat subjects experienced changes overnight as well.  This hypothesis was informed when an inventory check after the incident found almost twenty rats had gone missing from their cages overnight.] 可以相信的是，有數個其他的測試老鼠也在一夜之間產生變化。當事故之後進行盤點後發現有20多隻老鼠遺失了，前述的說法已經往上報了。
[Time also appears to play a large role in post-mortem revivification, as does sustained trauma insufficient to permanently disable the subject.  Sufficient amounts of trauma in short periods of time lead to deactivation of XE037, but smaller amounts over several days cause it to expand.] 時間也同時是死後復甦的一個重要角色，持續的創傷無法永久的癱瘓測試對象。短時間達到一定量的傷害能夠讓XE037暫時失去行動力，但是經過數天之後殘餘的XE037又會再擴散。
[Today we applied a very small sample of XE037, suspended in water, to subject TP92, prior to necessary termination.  During the postmortem examination, the subject went through a revivification progress, but displayed next to no human intelligence.] 今天我們利用XE037的極小樣本，添加到水裡，來對TP92測試對象來進行實驗，並預先終結測試對象。在進行屍檢時，測試對象出現復活的程序，但是並沒有顯示出有人類智力的狀況。
[Today we found our solution, quite by accident.  It was found that XE037 is completely removed from a revivified body following a series of extremely-high energy 4th dimensional transpositions.  Unfortunately, this invariably allows subplane life forms to pass into the prime plan.  The cure is worse than the disease.] 今天我們意外的找到了解決方案。發現復活的人體經過了一系列極高能量的四維空間通道，會徹底移除XE037。不幸的是，這個方法同時也能夠讓異空間的生命體進入到我們的次元。解法比疾病更糟。
[Today we tested weaponry against XE142 and XE157, two amorphous subprime samples.  Their form proved to be nearly invulnerable to projectile based weaponry, but they were susceptible to directed energy weapons and flagration.] 今天我們測試了各種武器來對抗XE142和XE157這兩種次級無定形樣本。這些樣本的狀態證明了拋射武器對其是幾乎無用的，但是它們會受到指向性能量武器的傷害並爆炸。
[We have created a new department to investigate the effects of XE037 on the human body, specifically to examine the revivification effect observed on two prior occasions.  Sadly, our human subject pool is dwindling due to the short lifespan of subjects in this program.  More will be acquired soon.] 我們已經創建了一個新的部門來研究XE037對人體的影響，特別是檢查先前兩次事件的復活影響。不幸的是，我們的人類測試對象庫存因為此計畫而不斷減少。在近期內會進行補充。
[We have even more distressing news than the widespread XE037 contamination, there are reports of the XE037 mutating into various new variants.  See data files on XE037a - XE037f.  Research on the effects of these variants is ongoing.  We do know that XE037d shows signs of PE062 immunity, and XE037b can revive various breeds of canines.  However, revival is not as guaranteed as standard XE037 humanoid infection.  Canine body size seems to influence the chances.  See experiment tXE037b_c.] 我們出現了比XE037擴散更嚴重的問題，有報告指出XE037出現了許多形式的變種。參見資料檔案XE037a到XE037f。研究這些變異仍然持續。我們知道XE037d呈現對PE062免疫的狀況，而XE037b能夠復活各種犬科動物。然而，復活不一定保證發生像標準的XE037的人類感染形式。犬科的軀體尺寸似乎影響到復活的成功機率。參見 tXE037b_c 的解釋文件。
[We have finally found success in S37BEP, our emergency investigation into the destruction of XE037 in living subjects.  8 of 10 of the subjects showed no revivification, despite confirmed dosages of XE037.] 我們終於在S37BEP的計畫-緊急研究摧毀活體內的XE037，取得了進展。儘管已加入了一般劑量的XE037，十個測試對象中有八個並未顯示出復活跡象。
[We have made a fascinating discovery; by creating a miniature portal with low stability and high power, one can transpose into the 4th dimension and return immediately, but shifted by several meters.  Our subjects oscillated so quickly that none were even aware that they had visited lower planes.] 我們已經達成了一個有趣的發現；透過高能量來產生一個微型通道，一個人就能夠傳送到四維空間並迅速返回，而且還會位移若干公尺的距離。測試對象的振盪速度之快，快到連他們自己都沒察覺傳送的過程。
[XE037 revivification has reached critical levels, which are rapidly overwhelming the available military and regional police assets' ability to stop.  Every team in the field has encountered hostile specimens, and several are no longer responding to communications.  Dr. Savage has proposed a strategic redeployment to the underground complex known as the VAULT, and continuing production of PE062 there.] 
[XE037 shows promise as a catalyst for both cloning and treatments that mimic stem cells.  This is further evidence supporting Hendelson's theory of a near universal symbiotic relationship involving XE037.] XE037可望成為進行複製幹細胞治療的一種催化劑。進一步的證據支持了韓德森的生物共生理論，

[I don't know.  I mean, if you can make yourself useful.  But that's become a real hazy thing nowadays.  It depends who you ask.  The merchant definitely doesn't want me here when I'm not selling, but... some people get away with it.]

[That sure is a shiny badge you got there!] 你那真是一個閃亮亮的警徽啊！
[That's just our nickname for them.  They're what's left of the federal government.  Don't know how legitimate they are but they are named after some military unit that once protected the president.  Their liaison is usually hanging around here somewhere.] 
[That's pretty blunt!] 那角真是漂亮！
[Then leave, you have two feet.] 你有腳，自己離開。
[This is a refugee center that we've made into a sort of trading hub.] 這個難民中心已經被我們改造成了貿易中心了。
[Uh, not really.  Go talk to a merchant if you have anything to sell.  Otherwise the Old Guard liaison might have something, if you can find him.] 
[Well alright then.] 嗯，好吧。
[Well mostly no.  Just don't go around robbing others and starting fights and you will be all set.  Also, don't go into the basement.  Outsiders are not allowed in there.] 
[Well, bye.] 好吧，再見。
[Well, then...] 好吧，那麼...
[Well, there's a guy downstairs who got a working pneumatic cannon.  It shoots metal like... like a cannon without the bang.  Cost-efficient as hell.

[Yes of course.  Just don't bring any trouble and it's all fine by me.] 
[You are asking the wrong person, should look for our merchant by the main entrance.  Perhaps one of the scavengers is also interested.] 
[You're disgusting.] 你真噁心。

[After firing your gun, you will probably notice a Recoil alert in the lower right.  Generally speaking, the more damaging the ammo, the worse the recoil.  Recoil severely reduces your chance to hit, but you can eliminate recoil by pausing ('.') for a turn or moving normally.  High strength reduces recoil, so weak characters might want to stick to .22 or 9mm guns.] 
[Hitting a monster will stun it briefly, allowing you to escape or get in another attack.  Your dexterity and melee skills are used to determine whether an attack hits, while strength affects damage.] 擊中敵人時會短暫的震暈它，讓你有空檔可以逃離或是繼續追擊。你的敏捷和近戰能力決定攻擊的命中率，而力量則會影響傷害大小。
[If you press 'i' and then the letter of your weapon, you'll see its combat stats.  Bashing damage ignores most armor, but varies greatly and requires strength.  Cutting damage is a fixed amount, but is blocked by armor.  The To-hit bonus affects your chances of hitting.  The amount of time it takes to swing your melee weapon depends on both its size and weight; small, compact weapons are the fastest.] 
[It's dark down here!  Fortunately, you have a flashlight.  Press 'a' and then select your flashlight to turn it on.] 這裡一片漆黑！不過幸好你有帶著手電筒 ，按下 'a' 鍵，然後選擇你的手電筒來開啟它。
[It's dark down here!  Without a source of light, you'll be limited to seeing only one space in any direction.  You'll encounter darkness while underground or at night.  Press '<' to go back upstairs, and look around for a flashlight.] 這裡一片漆黑！少了光源你只能看到周圍一格的範圍，只要是在地鐵或是晚上都是這樣，按下 '<' 鍵回到樓上，去找把手電筒吧。
[Most monsters will have to smash their way through a closed door.  If a door is locked or stuck, you can smash it by pressing 's' and then a movement key.] 大部分的怪物都必須要破壞關閉的門才能通過。若是門被鎖住或是卡住，你能夠利用's'選擇方向來砸爛該門。(xap)
[Once you have a loaded gun wielded, you can fire it.  Press the 'f' key to fire a single shot.  With many guns, you can fire a burst by pressing 'F'.  You'll automatically target the last monster you shot at, or the closest monster to you.  You can change your target with the movement keys, or cycle through monsters with '<' and '>'.  To fire, press 'f' or '.'; to cancel, hit the escape key.] 
[Taking damage often causes pain.  Small amounts of pain are tolerable, but as it gets worse your stats will drop and you will move much slower.  To reduce pain, take painkillers like codeine, or simply wait it out.] 受到傷害通常會造成疼痛。小數值的疼痛能夠被忍受，但是隨著數值的增加你各種屬性受到的影響也就越大。要減少疼痛，服用止痛藥，類似可待因，就能簡單的把疼痛降低。
[That brown '+' next to you is a closed door.  To open it, either simply walk into it, or press 'o' and then a movement key.] 你身旁的棕色 '+' 符號代表一扇闔上的門，直接走過去或是按下字母 'o' 配合方向鍵來開啟。
[That drug you just took is a painkiller.  Painkillers are very important to keep on hand, as pain both penalizes your stats and makes you slower.  Be careful, as the stronger painkillers can make you woozy, and some are even addictive.] 你剛剛吞下去的是止痛藥，身上隨時帶著止痛藥是重要的，因為受傷不但會降低能力值還會減緩你的移動速度。不過要注意，藥效太強的止痛藥會讓你頭暈目眩，還有可能會上癮。
[That drug you just took placed an effect on you.  To check your effects, press '@'.  Most only last a short while, while others, like chronic disease, last until cured by some other means.] 你剛吃下去的藥起了作用。按下 '@' 來檢視。大部分症狀都會在短時間內治癒，不過有少數慢性疾病會一直維持到你用其他方法治療為止。
[That yellow > next to you is a staircase leading down.  To go downstairs, step onto the staircase and press the '>' key.  Similarly, a yellow < is stairs leading up, and can be followed with the '<' key.] 在你身旁的黃色>符號代表向下的樓梯，站在符號上按下 '>'即可下樓，同理<符號代表往高一層的樓梯，按下 '<'即可上樓。
[The '@' character in the center of the screen represents you.  To move, you can use the numpad, the vikeys (hjklyubn), or the arrow keys.  To have your character wait in place, press '.'] 在畫面中央的'@'符號代表玩家你。要移動，你能夠使用九宮數字鍵、hjklyubn、或是方向鍵。要讓你的角色在原地等待，按下'.' (xap)
[The Examine command is useful for grabbing items off window frames, around corners, etc.  It's also used for interacting with a few terrain types.  Interactive terrain is usually designated with a '6' symbol.] 
[The item you just picked up has been wielded as a weapon automatically.  This happened because it is a good melee weapon, and you were empty-handed.  This usually is faster than than picking it up, then wielding it.] 你剛撿取的物品被自動手持作為武器了。這是因為該物品是好的近戰武器，而你是空手的。這樣動作會比撿取東西再從物品欄進行手持動作要快的多。(xap)
[The item you just picked up has been wielded as a weapon automatically.  This happened because you do not have space in your inventory to stash the item, and so you must carry it in your hand.  To expand your inventory space, try wearing clothing with a lot of storage space, like a backpack, or cargo pants.] 你剛撿取的物品被自動手持作為武器了。會發生這種狀況通常代表你的物品欄沒有足夠的儲物空間能夠收藏該物品，所以你必須用雙手拿著。要拓展儲物空間，試著穿上有許多儲物空間的衣物，類似背包，或是工作褲。(xap)
[The item you just picked up is a comestible!  To eat a comestible, press 'E'.  Comestibles are items you can use up, like food, drink, pills, etc.  Most food expires eventually, so be careful.  Some comestibles, especially drugs, can cause subtle, long-term effects.] 
[The item you just picked up is a firearm!  Guns are very powerful weapons but they require ammunition.  Firearms have many special attributes.  Most modify the damage done by their ammunition.  They also have dispersion, which affects their chance to hit.  Some guns are semi-automatic, while others can fire a burst.  Some firearms (mainly bows and other muscle-powered weapons) have a range, which is added on top of the ammo's range when firing.] 
[The item you just picked up is a good weapon!  To wield a weapon, press w, then pick what to wield.  To wield nothing, either drop your weapon with d, or press 'w-' to put it away.  A zombie has spawned nearby.  To attack it, simply move into it.] 你剛撿取的物品是很好的武器！要手持武器，按下'w'，並選取要手持的物品。要變為徒手狀態，可以用'd'來丟棄武器，或是'w-'來收起。有殭屍在附近要攻擊的話只要朝著其方向移動即可。(xap)
[The item you just picked up is a tool!  To activate a tool, press 'a'.  Some tools have a set charge, which can be reloaded once depleted.  Other are single-use items, and still others are reusable.] 你剛撿起來的是一個工具！按下 'a' 鍵來使用它。有些工具有使用次數，重新裝載後可以再次使用。而其他工具不是一次性就是無限次數的。
[The item you just picked up is a type of clothing!  To wear clothing, press W and then select an item.  To take off clothing, press T, or simply take it off and drop it in one action by pressing d.] 你剛撿取的物品是一種衣物！要穿戴衣物，按下'W'並選擇物品。要脫下衣物，按下'T'，或是簡單的按下'd'來把該物品脫下並丟棄在地上。(xap)
[The item you just picked up is ammunition, used with a gun.  It has many special attributes.  The damage value is the maximum done on a standard hit; a critical hit or headshot will do much more damage.  Some monsters or NPCs will wear armor which reduces the damage from gunfire; a high Armor-pierce value will reduce this effect.  The Range is the maximum range the ammo can achieve, and the dispersion affects its chance to hit.] 你剛撿取的物品是彈藥，使用於槍械上。有許多不同種類的屬性。傷害屬性指的是正常命中時的數值；爆擊命中或是爆頭將能造成更
大的傷害。某些怪物或是NPC會穿戴護甲來降低遭受的傷害；高穿甲屬性數值能夠降低護甲的影響。距離屬性指的是彈藥的有效距離
，而彈著分散屬性影響了命中率。(xap)
[The item you just picked up went into your inventory, the shared storage space of all the clothing you're wearing.  To view your inventory, press 'i'.  You can then press the letter of any item to get more information about it.] 
[The nearby { is a display rack, and the blue background indicates that there are items there.  If you examine the square by pressing 'e', you can pick up items without moving to the square.] 附近的 { 符號為展示架，而藍色背景指的是有物品在這。若是你按下'e'來檢視該格子，你就能夠在不移動到該格子上的情況下撿取物品。(xap)
[To see what the symbols around you mean, press ';'.  You'll be able to scroll around and get information on the terrain, monsters, and items in the world around you.] 要了解各符號代表的意義，按下';'。你將能夠四處捲動，並了解地形地物的各種資訊，包括各種在你周圍的怪物與物品。(xap)
[To use a gun, first wield it with the 'w' key.  Next you need to reload using the 'r' key, assuming you have the proper ammo.  If you wish to unload your gun, possibly to change ammunition types, press 'U'.] 在使用槍之前，你需要先按下 'w' 鍵來進行手持動作，假設你有帶相對應的子彈的話使用 'r' 鍵來進行裝填子彈。你可以按下 'U' 鍵來卸下彈夾以換上不同的類型的子彈。
[Welcome to the Cataclysm tutorial!  As you play, pop-ups like this one will appear to guide you through the basic game actions.  Pressing spacebar will close the pop-up.] 歡迎來到災變的教學模式！當你遊玩的時候，類似這個彈出訊息將會指導你進行基本的遊戲操作。按下 空白鍵 將會關閉這個彈出
訊息。(xap)
[When you kill a monster it will often leave behind a corpse.  Corpses can be important sources of food, but you must Butcher them by standing on the corpse and pressing 'B'.  You'll need a bladed weapon in your inventory, preferably a small, very sharp one.  An unskilled butcher may only get a few pieces of meat, or none at all.  Note that many monsters, such as zombies, leave tainted meat, unsuitable for consumption.] 當你殺害了怪物通常會留下屍體。屍體有時是重要的食物來源，但是你必須先站在屍體上按下'B'來進行屠宰。你必須在物品欄中有刀刃的武器，最好是小而尖銳的。一個沒技巧的屠宰可能只能得到少量的肉，甚至完全沒有。注意，許多的怪物，像是殭屍，會留下感染的肉，這是不適合食用的。
[You can close an opened door by pressing 'c' and then a movement key.  Closing doors behind you can often slow down throngs of monsters greatly.] 
[You can smash through windows by pressing 's' and then a movement key.  A smashed window takes a long time to climb through, and it's possible to hurt yourself on the broken glass, but it's a good last-ditch escape route.  You can smash through other things, too.] 
[You don't have space in your inventory to store the item you just tried to pick up.  You need to wear something with storage space, like a backpack or cargo pants, to gain more storage space.] 你的物品欄沒有足夠的儲物空間來儲存你要撿取的物品。你需要穿戴上有提供儲物空間的東西才能增加空間，像是背包或是工作褲。
[You just activated a grenade!  You probably want to throw it.  To throw an item, press 't' and then select the item to throw.  The maximum range depends on your strength and the object's weight and size.  Throwing isn't very good in most combat situations, but if you've got some fire power...] 你剛拉下了手榴彈的插梢！你最好趕快投擲出去。按下 't' 來選取物品進行投擲。投擲的最遠距離取決於你的力量和物品的重量及大小。
投擲物品的動作在大部分的戰鬥中起不了什麼太大的作用，除非你丟的是手榴彈之類的東西...
[You just drank a bottle of water, reducing your thirst level and reducing the water level in the bottle.  You'll probably want to drop empty bottles, or you might want to save them to refill from a water source later.] 你剛喝了一瓶水，止了些渴也讓瓶中的水減少了。你可以選擇丟掉空瓶，或是留著拿來裝水。
[You just placed a trap.  Traps are permanent until set off, and can be an important defensive tactic, particularly when sleeping in unsafe territory.  Try stepping on that _ -- don't worry, it's a harmless bubblewrap trap.] 
[You just put on an article of clothing that protects against the environment.  The most common and important are respiratory devices, which will protect you against smoke, air-born toxins or organisms, and other common hazards.  However, they also make it a little harder to breath when running, so you'll move more slowly.  To check encumbrance, press @.] 
[You just put on an article of clothing that provides ample storage space.  This will allow you to carry much more stuff, but be aware that there is also a limit on the weight you can carry which depends on strength.  The item you put on also encumbered your torso.  This will make combat a little more difficult.  To check encumbrance, press @.] 
[You just put on an article of clothing that provides physical protection.  There are two types of damage that clothing defends against, bashing, and cutting.  Most monsters deal bashing damage, but cutting is often the more deadly of the two.  Bullets are considered cutting damage.] 
[You just stepped on a space with one or more items.  If you wish to pick it up, press ',' or 'g'.] 你現在腳下有一個或多個道具，你可以按下 ',' 或是 'g' 來撿取。
[You're carrying more volume than you have storage for, which means you are carrying some stuff in the crook of your arm or in some other awkward manner.  While overloaded like this, you will suffer SEVERE encumbrance penalties, making combat dangerous.  Either drop an item, or possibly wield something-- the object you are wielding does not take up inventory space.] 
[~ is a terrain symbol that indicates water.  From a water source like this, you can fill any containers you might have.  Step onto the water, then press the pickup key (',' or 'g'), then select a watertight container to put the water into.] ~ 是一個代表含水的地形符號，類似這樣的水源你可以拿容器裝水，站在水上面按下 (',' 或是 'g') 鍵來選擇一個水密容器裝水。

      The EPA has opposed the Security-Restricted Containment

  that these facilities would be constructed so close to populated
  areas, and only agreed to sign-off on the project if we were
  allowed to freely examine and monitor the sarcophagi.  But that
  has not happened.  Since then, the DoE has employed any and all

[ENTRY 47:
Our normal mining routine has unearthed a hollow chamber.  This would not be
out of the ordinary, save for the odd, perfectly vertical faultline found.
This faultline has several odd concavities in it which have the more
superstitious crew members alarmed; they seem to be of human origin.

ENTRY 48:
The concavities are between 10 and 20 feet tall, and run the length of the
faultline.  Each one is vaguely human in shape, but with the proportions of
the limbs, neck and head greatly distended, all twisted and curled in on
themselves.
] 記錄 47：
我們在日常的採礦工作挖掘出一個中空的空間。另外更不正常的是， 
還找到了一個有完美垂直的斷崖。
這個斷崖上有數個詭異的凹洞，一些迷信的工人們非常緊張；
並且這些凹洞像是人造的。

記錄 48：
這些凹洞大約 10 到 20 呎高，大大小小分布在整個斷崖上。 
每個看起來都像人的形狀，但四肢及脖子的部份卻是拉長的，
整個凹洞是扭曲的。

[ENTRY 49:
We've stopped mining operations in this area, obviously, until archaeologists
have the chance to inspect the area.  This is going to set our schedule back
by at least a week.  This stupid artifact-preservation law has been in place
for 50 years, and hasn't even been up for termination despite the fact that
these mining operations are the backbone of our economy.

ENTRY 52:
Still waiting on the archaeologists.  We've done a little light inspection of
the faultline; our sounding equipment is insufficient to measure the depth of
the concavities.  The equipment is rated at 15 miles depth, but it isn't made
for such narrow tunnels, so it's hard to say exactly how far back they go.

I noticed a couple of the guys down in the chamber with a chisel, breaking
off a piece of the sheer wall.  I'm looking the other way.  It's not like
the eggheads are going to notice a little piece missing.  Fuck em.

Well, the archaeologists are down there now with a couple of the boys as
guides.  They're hardly Indiana Jones types; I doubt they been below 20
feet.  I hate taking guys off assignment just to babysit the scientists, but
if they get hurt we'll be shut down for god knows how long.

ENTRY 58:
They're bringing in ANOTHER CREW?  Christ, it's just some cave carvings!  I
know that's sort of a big deal, but come on, these guys can't handle it?
] 記錄 54：
我發現有一些在那個空間的人在用鑿子敲岩壁，並採集斷崖的碎片。
我正在想辦法，讓這些傻子不會發現碎片不見了，爽啦。

記錄 55:
嗯，現在這些考古學家跟一些看起來不像印第安瓊斯的男性嚮導在下面；
我看他們應該連20英呎都下不去，我討厭當這些科學家的保母， 
但如果他們受傷了，天知道這礦坑會被封閉多久。

記錄 58：
他們居然帶來了另一組人？老天，這只是一堆洞穴啊！
我知道這沒有什麼大不了，但是拜託，現有人力沒辦法處理嗎？

[8: Frequently Asked Questions (Some spoilers!)] 
[<color_blue>( Assault Rifles</color>
Assault rifles are similar to hunting rifles in many ways; they are also suited for long range combat, with similar bonuses and penalties. Unlike hunting rifles, assault rifles are capable of automatic fire. Assault rifles are less accurate than hunting rifles, and this is worsened under automatic fire, so save it for when you're highly skilled. 
Assault rifles are an excellent choice for medium or long range combat, or even close-range bursts again a large number of enemies. They are difficult to use, and are best saved for skilled riflemen.] <color_blue>( 突擊步槍</color>
突擊步槍與來福獵槍有許多相似點；他們同樣都很適合進行遠距離戰鬥，有著相似的加成與懲罰。但不像來福獵槍，突擊步槍能夠使用全自動連發射擊。突擊步槍的命中率比來福獵槍稍微低了點，而使用連發射擊時命中率更低，所以當你的技能較高的時候再來使用會比較好。
突擊步槍是中長成戰鬥的好選擇，而近距離時也能利用連發的大量子彈來對付大量的敵人。雖然使用門檻較高，但是在熟手上是個好用的武器。
[<color_brown>( Hunting Rifles</color>
Hunting rifles are popular for their superior range and accuracy. What's more, their scopes or sights make shots fired at targets more than 10 tiles away as accurate as those with a shorter range. However, they are very poor at hitting targets 4 squares or less from the player. Unlike assault rifles, hunting rifles have no automatic fire. They are also slow to reload and fire, so when facing a large group of nearby enemies, they are not the best pick.] <color_brown>( 來福獵槍</color>
來福獵槍的優勢在其超群的射程以及命中率。更重要的是，透過其瞄準鏡或是覘孔能夠順利的擊中10格以外的目標。然而，在 4 格內的目標卻很不容易擊中。不像突擊步槍，來福獵槍沒有全自動連發射擊。同時其裝填與射擊速度都很慢，所以當面對一大隊敵人的時候，你還是換個武器吧。
[<color_cyan>( Submachine Guns</color>
Submachine guns are small weapons (some are barely larger than a handgun), designed for relatively close combat and the ability to spray large amounts of bullets. However, they are more effective when firing single shots, so use discretion. They mainly use the 9mm and .45 ammunition; however, other SMGs exist. They reload moderately quickly, and are suitable for close or medium-long range combat.] <color_cyan>( 衝鋒槍</color>
衝鋒槍是一種小型的武器（有些甚至比手槍還小），是設計在近距離戰鬥時快速射擊出大量子彈的武器。然而，在單發射擊時也很有效，所以要斟酌使用。通常使用 9mm 或 .45 口徑的彈藥；另外也有其他口徑的衝鋒槍。衝鋒槍能夠快速的重新裝填，並且適合用在近距離或中長程的戰鬥上。
[<color_green>( Crossbows</color>
The best feature of crossbows is their silence. The bolts they fire are only rarely destroyed; if you pick up the bolts after firing them, your ammunition supply will last much longer. Crossbows suffer from a short range and a very long reload time (modified by your strength); plus, most only hold a single round. 
For this reason, it is advisable to carry a few loaded crossbows. Crossbows can be very difficult to find; however, it is possible to craft one given enough Mechanics skill. Likewise, it is possible to make wooden bolts from any number of wooden objects, though these are much less effective than steel bolts. Crossbows use the handgun skill.] <color_green>( 十字弓</color>
十字弓最佳的優點就是無聲。而射出的箭矢也常常可以回收；若是你撿取了射出的箭矢，就能夠保持彈藥量。十字弓缺點就是射擊距離短以及超長的裝填時間（由你的力量高低決定）；另外，大部分的十字弓一次只能裝填一發。
因此，一次攜帶數把已上膛的十字弓是較佳的策略。十字弓也相當難被找到；然而，有足夠的機械技能就有可能自行製作出來。同樣的，也能夠用木製物品來製作箭矢，儘管傷害值不像鋼製箭矢大。操作十字弓用到手槍技能。
[<color_ltgray>( Handguns</color>
Handguns are small weapons held in one or both hands. They are much more difficult to aim and control than larger firearms, and this is reflected in their poor accuracy. However, their small size makes them appropriate for short-range combat, where larger guns fare poorly. They are also relatively quick to reload and use a very wide selection of ammunition. Their small size and low weight make it possible to carry several loaded handguns, switching from one to the next once their ammo is spent.] <color_ltgray>( 手槍</color>
手槍是一種可單雙手持的小型武器。它比較大的槍械更難瞄準及控制，反映在它孱弱的命中率上。然而，當其他較大的槍枝表現不佳時，因為手槍的的小尺寸讓他很適合使用在近距離戰鬥上。手槍同時也能進行快速的裝填，並且能使用許多種類的彈藥。小型的尺寸以及輕量，讓玩家能夠攜帶多把上膛的手槍，在一個種類的手槍子彈用完時就能夠換成用另外一種彈藥的手槍。
[<color_ltred>( Machine Guns</color>
Machine guns are one of the most powerful firearms available. They are even larger than assault rifles, and make poor melee weapons; however, they are capable of holding 100 or more rounds of highly-damaging ammunition. They are not built for accuracy, and firing single rounds is not very effective. However, they also possess a very high rate of fire and somewhat low recoil, making them very good at clearing out large numbers of enemies.] <color_ltred>( 機槍</color>
機槍是遊戲中其中一類強力的槍械。他們的體積比突擊步槍大很多，因此沒辦法拿來當近戰武器；但是他們能夠裝填高達 100 發以上的高傷害子彈。這種武器不是已高命中率來設計的，所以單發射擊沒什麼效率。然而，他們卻能以極高的射擊速度與低後座力，來達成掃除大量敵人的任務。
[<color_magenta>( Energy Weapons</color>
Energy weapons is an umbrella term used to describe a variety of rifles and handguns which fire lasers, plasma, or energy attacks. They started to appear in military use just prior to the start of the apocalypse, and as such are very difficult to find.
Energy weapons have no recoil at all; they are nearly silent, have a long range, and are fairly damaging. The biggest drawback to energy weapons is scarcity of ammunition; it is wise to reserve the precious ammo for when you really need it.] <color_magenta>( 能量武器</color>
能量武器是對於各種步槍或手槍，只要是發射雷射，電漿，或是其他發射能量彈武器的總稱。他們在災變發生時才剛研發出來，因此非常稀少。
能量武器完全沒有後座力；幾乎是靜音的，並且能夠對於遠距離的目標造成大量傷害。而能量武器的弱點就是彈藥相當稀少；因此要保留彈藥，除非到了非用不可的地步。
[<color_red>( Shotguns</color>
Shotguns are some of the most powerful weapons in the game, capable of taking out almost any enemy with a single hit. Birdshot and 00 shot spread, making it very easy to hit nearby monsters. However, they are very ineffective against armor, and some armored monsters might shrug off 00 shot completely. Shotgun slugs are the answer to this problem; they also offer much better range than shot.
The biggest drawback to shotguns is their noisiness. They are very loud, and impossible to silence. A shot that kills one zombie might attract three more! Because of this, shotguns are best reserved for emergencies.] <color_red>( 散彈槍</color>
散彈槍是遊戲中其中一種強大的武器，擁有一擊必殺的能力。可使用獵鳥散彈及獵鹿散彈來簡單的命中怪物。然而，這武器對付裝甲是相當沒有效率的，甚至有些裝甲的怪物對於獵鹿散彈的攻擊是免疫的。而重擊散彈能夠解決這個問題；同時也能加長射程。
散彈槍的缺點就是造成的聲音過大。非常大的聲音，以致於無法低調行動。只要對著殭屍射擊了一發，就會吸引附近全部的殭屍！正因如此，散彈槍最好留在緊急的時候才使用。
[<color_yellow>( Bows</color>
Silent, deadly, easy to make, and the arrows are reusable. Bows have been used forever. Bows are two handed and require the user to have a certain strength level. If you do not have enough strength to draw the string back, you will fire at a reduced effectiveness. This reduces the reload and fire speeds and decreases the range of the arrows fired. 
Most normal bows require strength of at least 8, others require an above average strength of 10, or a significant strength of 12. Bows use the archery skill.] <color_yellow>( 弓</color>
安靜，致命，容易使用以及使用可重覆回收的箭矢。弓長期以來扮演著重要的角色。弓需要使用雙手操作而且它對使用者的力量有一定的要求。如果你沒有足夠的力量將弓拉開，將會降低用弓的效率。不僅降低了重新填裝和發射的速度，也降低了射程。 
大多數的弓要求至少 8 點的力量，其他則要求10點力量，或是12點力量。此武器使用弓術技能。
[=       Ammunition
Ammunition is worthless without a gun to load it into. Generally, there are several variants for any particular calibre. Ammunition has damage, dispersion, and range ratings, and an armor-piercing quality.] = 彈藥
沒有可用槍械的彈藥等於廢物。一般來說，有各式各樣種類的彈藥。彈藥有不同的傷害、彈著分散、有效射程、穿甲與否的特性。

Stimulants provide you with a temporary rush of energy, increasing your movement speed and many stats (most notably intelligence), making them useful study aids. There are two drawbacks to stimulants: they make it more difficult to sleep and, more importantly, most are highly addictive. Stimulants range from the caffeine rush of cola to the more intense high of Adderall and methamphetamine.] 另一種常見的藥物就是興奮劑。興奮劑能夠讓你暫時的提昇能力，增加你的移動速度或是許多屬性，特別的是智力能夠讓你增加學習效率。興奮劑有兩個缺點；會讓人難以入眠，而最最重要的是很容易上癮。從可樂的咖啡因到安非他命及冰毒都是屬於興奮劑。
[As time passes, you will begin to feel hunger and thirst. When this happens, a status warning at the sidebar will appear. As hunger and thirst reach critical levels, you will begin to suffer movement penalties. Thirst is more dangerous than hunger. Finding food in a city is usually easy; outside of a city, you may have to hunt. After killing an animal, stand over the animal's corpse and butcher it into small chunks of meat by pressing %s. You might also be able to forage for edible fruit or vegetables; to do it, find a promising plant and examine it. Likewise, you may have to drink water from a river or another natural source. To collect it, stand in shallow water and press %s. You'll need a watertight container to store it. Be forewarned that some sources of water aren't trustworthy and may produce diseased water. To make sure it's healthy, purify the water by boiling it or using water purifier before drinking.] 隨著時間的過去，你將會開始感到飢餓以及口渴。在畫面的下方會出現這些狀態的警告。飢餓及脫水若到達危及的程度，你將會開始受到移動懲罰。脫水的危險程度比飢餓高。在城市中找尋食物通常比較容易；在郊外你可以進行狩獵，只要站在動物屍體旁並使用%s進行屠宰來分成數個肉塊。同樣的，在郊區你也可以從河裡取得水或其他天然資源；站在淺水中%s進行撿取。你將會需要水密容器。事先聲明，某些水源並不乾淨，可能造成疾病。為了確認是乾淨的飲用水，必須要利用淨水器來進行過濾。
[Becoming a skilled mechanic, you may want to tune your car up.  The coefficients of aerodynamics, friction and mass efficiency play significant roles it this process.  Named coefficients are measured in the range from 100%% (which means ideal conditions) to 0%% (terrible inefficiency).] 
[Before sleeping in a dangerous territory, it may be wise to set traps to ward off unwanted intrusions. There are a few traps to be found in the world, most notably bubble wrap (which will make a loud noise if stepped on, helping to wake you up) and bear traps (which make noise AND damage, and trap anything that steps on them). Others need to be crafted; this requires the Traps skill and possibly Mechanics.] 當在危險的地區進行睡眠時，設置陷阱來抵禦未知的入侵者才是明智的作法。遊戲世界中能夠找到一些陷阱，最常見的就是泡泡紙（當踩到時會發出明顯聲響，讓你醒來）以及捕獸夾（會發出聲響以及傷害踩上的任何東西）。其餘的就需要透過製作物品的方式才能取得；需要陷阱技能或是一些機械技能。
[Bionics are biomechanical upgrades to your body. While many are simply 'built-in' versions of items you would otherwise have to carry, some bionics have unique effects that are otherwise unobtainable. Some bionics are constantly working, whereas others need to be toggled on and off as needed.] 生化插件是透過生化技術來強化你的身體機能。許多插件是簡易的內建版本並較容易找到，同時也有一些難以取得的特殊用途插件。有些生化插件會持續作用，而其他的需要手動進行切換。
[Bionics come in ready-to-install canisters. Installation of a bionic is best left to a trained professional. However, you may attempt to perform a self-installation. Performing such a task requires high levels of intelligence, first aid, mechanics, and electronics. Beware though, a failure may cripple you! Many bionic canisters are difficult to find, but may be purchased from certain wandering vagabonds for a very high price.] 生化插件都是模組化的安裝零件。安裝生化插件時最好是交由熟練的專家。然而，你也可以嘗試自行安裝。執行這個動作需要高等級的智力，急救，機械，以及電子技能，否則安裝失敗可能會讓你殘廢! 許多生化插件都很難找到，但是你能夠從其他人身上以高額代價購買，或是... 你懂的。
[Cataclysm differs from the traditional roguelikes in several ways. Rather than exploring an underground dungeon, with a limited area on each level, you are exploring a truly infinite world, stretching in all four cardinal directions. In this survival roguelike, you will have to find food; you also need to keep yourself hydrated and sleep periodically.] Cataclysm與其他 roguelike 的遊戲有許多不同的地方。以往是探索地下城，通常每一階都是有限的區域， 而大災變中你探索的是四方無限寬廣的世界。另外像其他 roguelike 的遊戲的方面就是你需要找尋食物；你也需要保持不脫水，以及充分的睡眠。
[Cataclysm is a survival roguelike with a monster apocalypse setting. You have survived the original onslaught, but the future looks pretty grim.] Cataclysm是個有著末日設定及怪物的 roguelike 遊戲。 你在事件開端的混亂殺戮中倖存，但如何在接下來的日子生存才是真正的挑戰。
[Combat is much easier if you can fight just one monster at once. Use doorways as a choke point or stand behind a window and strike as the zombies slowly climb through. Never be afraid to just run if you can outpace your enemies. Irregular terrain, like forests, may help you lose monsters.] 如果一次是對一個怪物的時候，戰鬥會容易的多。運用狹窄的走廊來當做扼流點，或是站在窗戶後方來攻擊爬窗中的殭屍。假如你能擺脫敵人就快逃。不規則的地形，如森林，可以幫助你甩開怪物。
[Crafting an item with high difficulty may fail and possibly waste some materials. You should prepare spare material, just in case.] 製作高難度的物品時可能會因失敗而浪費一些材料。你應當準備一些備用材料以防萬一。
[Currently Available tokens:
	 c = category (books, food, etc)    | {c:books}
	 m = material (cotton, kevlar, etc) | {m:iron}
	 dgt = damage greater than (0-5)    | {dgt:2}
	 dlt = damage less than (0-5)       | {dlt:1}] 目前可用代碼:
	 c = 類別 (書籍, 食物, 等)    | {c:books}
	 m = 材質 (棉, 凱夫勒, 等) | {m:iron}
	 dgt = 傷害值大於 (0-5)    | {dgt:2}
	 dlt = 傷害值小於 (0-5)       | {dlt:1}
[Each step will take 100 movement points (or more, depending on the terrain); you will then replenish a variable amount of movement points, depending on many factors (press %s to see the exact amount).] 每次移動都需要100的行動點數（或依照地形有所增減）；接著你會重新獲得不等的行動點數，由許多因素決定（%s 觀看確實的數字）。
[Every 14 to 20 hours, you'll find yourself growing sleepy. If you do not sleep by pressing %s, you'll start suffering stat and movement penalties. You may not always fall asleep right away. Sleeping indoors, especially on a bed, will help. If that's not enough, sleeping pills may be of use. While sleeping, you'll slowly replenish lost hit points. You'll also be vulnerable to attack, so try to find a safe place to sleep, or set traps for unwary intruders.] 每14到20鐘頭，你將會產生睡意。假如你不按下 %s 來進行睡眠，你將會開始產生痛楚並且受到移動懲罰。你也可能在進行睡眠時不會很順利。在室內睡覺，特別是在床上將會有幫助。假如還不行，你也能使用安眠藥。當睡覺時，你將會慢慢的回復生命值。同時也容易受到攻擊，所以試著找到安全的地點或是設置陷阱來防範不速之客，再進行睡眠。
[F           Forest - May be dense or sparse. Slow moving; foragable food.] F           森林 - 有密集與稀疏之分。在裡面移動緩慢；有機食物。
[Fleeing will often be a solid tactic, especially when overwhelmed by a swarm of zombies. Try to avoid getting cornered inside a building. Ducking down into the subways or sewers is often an excellent escape tactic.] 逃跑通常是你的最好戰術，尤其是遭遇到了殭屍海的時候。試著避免在屋內角落被包圍。躲到類似地下鐵或是下水道都是很有用的戰術。
[For example, on her torso, a character might wear a leather corset (next-to-skin), a leather touring suit (standard), a trenchcoat (over), and a survivor's runner pack (belted). Her encumbrance penalty is 0. She could also wear one encumbrance 0 fitted item on any layer without triggering the penalty: for example, a tank top (next-to-skin) or a t-shirt (standard). If she put on a tank top AND a t-shirt, one of them would be penalized, bringing her encumbrance to 1.] 舉例來說，一個女性角色可以在軀幹上穿一件皮革馬甲（貼身層），一件皮革旅行套裝（普通層），一件風衣（外罩層），一個生存者慢跑背包（掛帶層） 。她的軀幹累贅會是0，額外在任何層穿上一個累贅為0且修改合身後的衣物都不會增加累贅懲罰：例如，背心（貼身層）或者T恤（普通層），但如果同時裝備這兩件，其中一件將會帶來懲罰而讓累贅度變成1。
[For the unarmed fighter, a variety of fighting styles are available. You can start with your choice of a single, commonly-taught style by starting with the Martial Arts Training trait. Many, many more can be found in their own traits, learned from manuals or by taking lessons from wandering masters.] 給徒手戰士的好消息，遊戲中有多樣化的戰鬥招數可以使用。你能夠在一開始藉由選擇 特質 中的 武術訓練 來取得一項自學而成的招式。還能夠在遊戲中藉由特定流浪師父的特質及書籍來學到更多更多的武術。
[Gun types:] 槍械種類：
[H=          Highway - Like roads, but lined with guard rails.] H=          公路 - 像是一般道路，但是兩旁有護欄。
[If you are suffering from drug withdrawal, taking more of the drug will cause the effects to cease immediately, but may deepen your dependence.] 假如你戒斷時身體受到影響而重新服用了更多藥物，雖然能夠立刻停止症狀，但是將會加深你的藥癮。
[If you become very irradiated, you may develop mutations. Most of the time, these mutations will be negative; however, many are beneficial, and others have both positive and negative effects. Your mutations may change your play style considerably. It is possible to find substances that will remove mutations, though these are extremely rare.] 若是你照射到過量的輻射，你可能會出現突變。大部分的突變都是負面的；然而，也有可能產生優勢的突變，或是好壞並存的突變。你的突變可能會大大的改變你的玩法。你也能夠找到特殊物質來移除突變，只是這類物質相當稀有。
[If you need to protect yourself from acid, clothing made of cloth < leather < kevlar < plastic. So while leather and kevlar will protect you from active enemies, a hazmat suit and rubber boots will make you nigh-immune to acid damage. Items made of glass, ceramics, diamond or precious metals will be totally immune to acid.] 
[In addition to the primary crafting skills, other skills may be necessary to create certain items. Traps, Marksmanship, and First Aid are all required for certain items.] 除了主要的製作相關技能，其他技能在製作特定物品時也可能用到。陷阱技能，射擊技能，以及急救技能，都在製作特定物品時會用到。
[In order to assume control of the vehicle, get to a location with "vehicle controls" and press %s. Once you are in control, %s accelerates, %s slows or reverses, & %s & %s turn left or right. Diagonals adjust course and speed. You default to cruise control, so the gas/brake adjust the speed which the vehicle will attempt to maintain.] 要開始控制車輛，要到有"車輛控制器"的位置並按 %s 。一旦你開始控制，%s 是加速，%s 是減速或倒車， %s 以及 %s 是左轉或右轉。相對調整行進路線和速度。預設都是定速控制，因此 油門/煞車 將會因你制定的速度而自動調整。
[It's a good idea to pull the handbrake - "s" - when parking, just to be safe. If you want to get out, hit the lights, toggle cruise control, turn the engine on or off, or otherwise use the vehicle controls, press %s to bring up the "Vehicle Controls" menu, which has options for things you'd do from the driver's seat.] 拉起手煞車很好用 - "s" - 能夠安全的停下車。假如你想要下車、開車燈、切換定速駕駛、關閉或啟動引擎等車輛控制功能，按 %s 來開啟 "車輛控制" 選單，就能夠從駕駛座來操作車輛相關功能。
[It's also important to carry a few medications; painkillers are a must-have, and drugs such as cigarettes will make your life easier (but beware of addiction). Leave the city as soon as you have a good stockpile of equipment. The high concentration of zombies makes them a deathtrap -- but a necessary resource of food and ammunition.] 攜帶一些藥物也是同樣重要的；止痛藥是必須有的，另外諸如香煙能讓生活更愜意（小心上癮）。在城市搜刮物資是一個死亡之旅 - 因為物資豐富的關係，聚集了成群的殭屍。當你蒐集足夠的物資後要儘快遠離城市。
[Item types:] 物品類型：
[Keep an eye on the weather. Wind and humidity will exacerbate dire conditions, so seek shelter if you're unable to withstand them. Staying dry is important, especially if conditions are so low that they would cause frostbite. If you're having trouble staying warm over night, make a pile of clothing on the floor to sleep on.] 隨時警惕天氣。風雨會使天氣狀況更加嚴峻，你若是沒辦法承受他們，就得快點尋求遮蔽物。保持乾爽是很重要的，尤其是惡劣的氣溫狀況下溼氣可能會造成凍傷。如果你無法在漫漫長夜中保持溫暖，把衣物堆在地上並睡在上面吧。
[Low morale will make you sluggish and unmotivated. If your morale drops very low, you won't be able to perform crafting at all. If you become sufficiently depressed, you will suffer stat penalties. Very high morale fills you with gusto and energy, and you will find yourself moving faster. At extremely high levels, you will receive stat bonuses.] 士氣低落時會讓你遲鈍，不積極。同時也會減低你的屬性，尤其是智力。假如你的士氣非常低落你還可能會自殺。士氣非常高漲時能讓你很有活力，並且可以增加移動速度。在極高的士氣等級時你能夠獲得屬性加成。
[MAP SYMBOLS:] 地圖符號:
[Many drugs have a potential for addiction. Each time you consume such a drug there is a chance that you will grow dependent on it. Consuming more of that drug will increase your dependence. Effects vary greatly between drugs, but all addictions have only one cure; going cold turkey. The process may last for days and will leave you very weak, so try to do it in a safe area.] 許多藥物有潛在的致癮作用。你每次服用的時候將會有一定的機率成長為藥物上癮。服用越多藥物將會增加依賴性，每種藥物的影響力差別很大，但要擺脫藥癮只有一個方法；停止服用。這個過程可能會持續幾天，並會讓你非常虛弱，所以請在安全的地點再進行嘗試。
[Many important items can be very hard to find or will cost a great deal of money to trade for. Fortunately, it is possible to craft a wide variety of goods (as best you can) with the proper tools, materials, and training.] 許多重要的物品難以被發掘，或是需要付出相當大的金錢才能購得。還好，透過正確的工具以及適當的零件、物質以及訓練就能夠製作出來。
[Many styles also have special effects unlocked under certain conditions. These are varied and unique to each style, and range from special combo moves to bonuses depending on the situation you are in. You can check these by examining your style.] 許多招式也包含了特殊效果，會在特定情況下解鎖。效果都很豐富並且獨特，依照情況從特殊連擊到屬性加成都有。你能夠檢視招式來查看效果。
[Many traps are fully or partially hidden. Your ability to detect traps is entirely dependent upon your Perception. Should you stumble into a trap, you may have a chance to avoid it, depending on your Dodge skill.] 許多陷阱都是完全或部分隱藏的。你偵測陷阱的能力完全仰賴於感知的屬性。你若是踏入一個陷阱則是需要閃避技能才能有機會躲開。
[Morale is also responsible for ensuring you can learn effectively, via a mechanic referred to as 'focus'. Your focus level is a measure of how effectively you can learn. The natural level is 100, which indicates normal learning potential. Higher or lower focus levels make it easier or harder to learn from practical experience.] 士氣同時也是影響學習效率的關鍵，透過稱為'專注'的屬性。專注力的高低直接影響到你學習的效率。正常等級是100，代表一般的學習能力。較高或較低的專注等級讓你較容易或較困難取得實際經驗。
[Most bionics require a source of power, and you will need an internal battery to store energy for them. Your current amount of energy is displayed below your health. Replenishing energy can be done in a variety of ways, but all require the installation of a special bionic just for fuel consumption.] 大部分的生化插件都需要能量來源，所以你需要一個能量儲存室來儲存能量。你目前的能量會顯示在生命值的下方。補充能量有許多方式，但是都需要先安裝特殊的生化插件才能達成。
[Most styles have a variety of special moves associated with them. Most have a skill requirement, and will be unavailable until you reach a level of unarmed skill. You can check the moves by pressing '?' in the pick style menu.] 大部分的招式都關連了許多特殊走位。大部分都需要一定的技能，不然就不會啟動，直到你達到徒手技能的特定等級。你能夠在你的招式選單按下 '?' 來檢視你的招式走位。
[Movement is performed using the numpad, or vikeys.] 移動的方法是使用數字鍵盤來達成，或是hjkl。
[Note colors: ] 註記顏色：
[Note that most painkillers take a little while to kick in. If you take some oxycodone and don't notice the effects right away, don't start taking more -  you may overdose and die!] 注意大部分的止痛藥服用後需要一些時間發揮藥效。假如你服用一些可待因酮，發現沒有立即見效，不要再繼續服用，你可能會服藥過量導致死亡！
[O           Parking lot - Empty lot, few items. Mostly useless.] O           停車場 - 空曠的場地，稀少的物品。大部分是無用的。
[Pain will also disappear with time, so if drugs aren't available and you're in a lot of pain, it may be wise to find a safe spot and simply rest for an extended period of time.] 疼痛也會隨著時間流逝而消失，假如無法服藥，而你很疼痛，也許找個安全的地點進行簡單而長時間的休息也不失為一個明智的方法。
[Please press one of the following for help on that topic:
Press q or ESC to return to the game.] 請按下以下標題以進行說明:
按 q 或 ESC 返回遊戲。
[Pressing %s opens a comparison menu, where you can see two items side-by-side with their attributes highlighted to indicate which is superior. You can also access the item comparison menu by pressing C after %s to view nearby items menu is open and an item is selected.] 按下 %s 來開啟比較選單，你能夠以並排方式觀察兩個物品，並且在差異部分會以高亮度標示較好的。你也能夠進行透過按下 C 鍵接著使用 %s 來進行物品比較。
[Q: Help! I started a fire and now my house is burning down!
A: Fires will spread to nearby flammable tiles if they are able. Lighting a fire in a set-up brazier, stove, wood stove, stone fireplace, or pit will stop it from spreading. Fire extinguishers can put out fires that get out of control.] Q:救命！我在我家生個火結果就火災了！
A:火焰首先會從附近的可燃物開始燒起。在設置好的火盆、柴爐、或是石爐中生火才不會造成火勢蔓延。滅火器能夠撲滅失去控制的火勢。
[Q: How can I cure a fungal infection?
A: Royal jelly, the Blood Filter bionic, and some antifungal chemicals can cure fungal infection. You can find royal jelly in the bee hives which dot forests. Antifungal chemicals to cure the fungal infection can either be found as random loot or made from other ingredients.] Q:我要怎麼樣才能治癒真菌感染？
A:蜂王漿，血液過濾生化插件，以及一些抗真菌的藥物都能治癒真菌感染。你能夠在森林的蜂巢中找到蜂王漿。抗真菌藥物能夠在隨機的物品中找到，或是利用其他物質製作。
[Q: How can I prevent monsters from attacking while I sleep?
A: Find a safe place to sleep, for example in a cleared building far from the front door. Set traps if you have them, or build a fire.] Q:我要怎麼樣才能防止在睡夢中被怪物攻擊？
A:找個安全的地方入睡，在遠離門口的建築物內。若是有陷阱的話就裝設起來，不然就是生個火。
[Q: How can I remove boards from boarded-up windows and doors?
A: Use a hammer and choose the direction of the boarded-up window or door to remove the boards.] Q:我要怎麼樣才能移除加固的門窗？
A:使用一把鎚子並選擇要拆除的門窗方向就能移除了。
[Q: How do I get into science labs?
A: You can enter the front door if you have an ID card by examining (%s) the keypad. If you are skilled in computers and have an electrohack, it is possible to hack the keypad. An EMP blast has a chance to force the doors open, but it's more likely to break them. You can also sneak in through the sewers sometimes, or try to smash through the walls with explosions.] Q:我要如何進入科學實驗室？
A:若是你有ID卡的話你就能夠從前門在讀卡機前按檢視(%s)進入。若你電腦技能高並且有電子駭客的話，你就能夠用駭客的方式侵入鍵盤。利用EMP電磁波也有機率把門打開，但是這樣很容易把門弄壞。你有時候也能夠從下水道進入，或是利用炸藥把門炸開。
[Q: I have a question that's not addressed here. How can I get an answer?
A: Ask the helpful people on the forum at smf.cataclysmdda.com or at the irc channel #CataclysmDDA on freenode.] Q:我的問題沒有列在這邊。我要怎樣才能取得解答？
A:你可以到論壇 smf.cataclysmdda.com 發問，或是上freenode的irc，頻道#CataclysmDDA（英文）。
[Q: I'm cold and can't sleep at night!
A: Gather some clothes and put them in the place you use to sleep in. Being hungry, thirsty, wet, or injured can also make you feel the cold more, so try to avoid these effects before you go to sleep.] Q:我好冷，我沒辦法在晚上入睡！
A:多收集些衣服並把它們放在你睡覺的地方。另外飢餓、口渴、潮溼以及受傷都會使你比平常更容易感到寒冷，因此儘可能避免在這些狀態下入眠。
[Q: It seems like everything I eat makes me sick! What's wrong?
A: Lots of the food found in towns is perishable and will only last a few days after the start of a new game. The electricity went out several days ago so fruit, milk and others are the first to go bad. After the first couple of days, you should switch to canned food, jerky, and hunting. Also, you should make sure to cook any food and purify any water you hunt up as it may contain parasites or otherwise be unsafe.] Q:為啥好像我每次吃東西都會生病！我哪裡做錯了？
A: 許多的在城鎮中找到的食物都是容易腐爛的，而只能夠在從開始遊戲時保鮮一段時間而已。電力供應在數天前便消失了，所以水果、牛奶以及其他的食物都會最快腐壞。當過了一些日子後，你應該換成吃罐頭食品、肉乾並且進行狩獵。你也應該確保用淨化過的水來烹調你獵捕的食物，不然有可能有寄生蟲或其他不安全的因素。
[Q: Shotguns bring in more zombies than they kill!  What's the point?
A: Shotguns are intended for emergency use. If you are cornered, use your shotgun to escape, then just run from the zombies it attracts.] Q:散彈槍殺的殭屍數量遠遠不及引來的殭屍數量！怎麼會這樣？
A:散彈槍是比較適合在緊急情況下才用。若是你被包圍了，才用你的散彈槍來突圍，然後逃到沒有殭屍追你的地方。
[Q: The game just told me to quit, and other weird stuff is happening.
A: You have the Schizophrenic trait, which might make the game seem buggy.] Q:這遊戲一直叫我退出，然後還有一些詭異的事物發作。
A:你應該是選到了精神分裂的特質，所以才會讓你感覺遊戲怪怪的。
[Q: What is Safe Mode, and why does it prevent me from moving?
A: Safe Mode is a way to guarantee that you won't die by holding a movement key down. When a monster comes into view, your movement will be ignored until Safe Mode is turned off with the ! key. This ensures that the sudden appearance of a monster won't catch you off guard.] Q:什麼是安全模式，為啥會讓我無法移動？
A:安全模式是能夠讓你不會因為按著一個方向太久，結果等放掉才發現已經被怪物殺死的一個機制。當一個怪物進入視野的時候，你的所有移動會被忽略，直到你用 '!' 把安全模式關閉。這樣能保證不會有怪物在你大意的時候追上你。
[Q: Why can't I carry anything?
A: At the start of the game you only have the space in your pockets. A good first goal of many survivors is to find a backpack or pouch to store things in. (The shelter basement is a good place to check first!)] Q:為什麼我什麼東西都帶不了？
A:在遊戲開始時你的口袋只有很少的儲物空間。一個良好的首要目標就是找個背包來儲存東西。（可以先檢查避難所的地下室！）
[Q: Why do I always sink when I try to swim?
A: Your swimming ability is reduced greatly by the weight you are carrying, and is also adversely affected by the clothing you wear. Until you reach a high level of the swimming skill, you'll need to drop your equipment and remove your clothing to swim, making it a last-ditch escape plan.] Q:為什麼我想要游泳都浮不起來？
A:你的游泳能力會被你身上的負重給嚴重影響，另外你穿的衣物也會影響。你必須要丟下你的裝備，並脫光光才能游泳，除非你的游泳技能達到一個水平。把游泳當成最後的逃命手段吧。
[Q: Why does my crafting fail so often?
A: Check the difficulty of the recipe, and the primary skill used; your skill level should be around one and a half times the difficulty to be confident that it will succeed.] Q: 為什麼我製作物品老是失敗？
A:檢查一下配方的難度，以及需求的技能；你的技能應該要至少達到需求的一半以上才容易成功。
[R           River - Most creatures can not swim across them, but you may.] R           河 - 大部分的生物都無法遊過，但你能。
[Road - Safe from burrowing animals.] 道路 - 躲避穴居動物的好地方。
[Some recipes require a set of tools. These are not used up when crafting, so you can keep your tool set. All recipes require one or more ingredients. These ARE used up in crafting.] 某些配方需要一組工具。這些工具不會被消耗，所以你可以保存你的工具組。所有的配方都需要消耗一或多個元件，才能進行物品製作。
[Swarms of monsters may call for firearms. If you find one, wield it first, then reload by pressing %s. If you wish to change ammo, you must unload the weapon by pressing %s, then reload again. To fire, press %s, move the cursor to the relevant space, then hit '.' or 'f'. Some guns have alternate firing modes, such as burst fire; to cycle modes, press %s. Firing continuously, especially in bursts, will severely reduce accuracy.] 遇到成群的怪物可能需要用到槍械了。假如你找到一把，先手持，然後按%s來重新裝填。假如你想要更換彈藥，你必須先按%s來清空武器，然後再重新裝填。要進行射擊，按%s，移動游標到對應的格子上接著按下 '.' 或 'f'。某些槍有多種射擊模式，例如連發；要切換模式，按%s。持續的射擊，尤其是連發，會造成命中率嚴重下降。
[The first thing to do is checking your starting location for useful items. Your initial storage is limited, and a backpack, trenchcoat, or other storage medium will let you carry a lot more. Finding a weapon is important; frying pans, butcher knives, and more are common in houses; hardware stores may carry others. Unless you plan on concentrating on melee combat, seek out gun stores as soon as possible and load up on more than one type.] 首先要做的事情就是檢查你的初始位置來找尋有用物品。你的初始儲存空間是有限的，取得背包，風衣，或是其他有儲物空間的物品能夠讓你攜帶更多東西。找個武器也是很重要的；平底鍋，菜刀，以及許多常見的用品；五金行可能還有更多其他的種類。除非你決心專注在近身戰鬥，不然從槍械商店取得多種槍械與彈藥是一個重要的目標。
[The player can often see more than can be displayed on the screen at a time. Pressing %s enters "look around mode", which allows you to scroll around using the movement keys and view items on the map as well as monsters and their stance toward the character. Pressing %s provides a list of nearby visible items, though items shut away in crates, cupboards, refrigerators and the like won't be displayed until you are close enough. Pressing Shift+vikeys (h,j,k,l,y,u,b,n) will scroll the view persistently, allowing you to keep an eye on things as you move around.] 角色通常可以看到比畫面顯示的更遠。按下 %s 進入 "環顧模式" 讓你能使用方向鍵捲動畫面並且在地圖上檢視物品。%s 列出附近可見物品的列表，除了一些被封存在木箱、紙箱、冰箱或是一些類似的容器不會被顯示。 按下 Shift+hjkl 鍵將將可以永久捲動視角， 讓你能在移動時還一直保持著看往某個方向。
[There are also lots of ways for your morale to decrease, beyond its natural decay. Eating disgusting food, reading a boring technical book, killing a friendly NPC, or going through drug withdrawal are some prominent examples.] 同時也有許多狀況會讓你士氣低落，排除原本的自然沮喪。吃難吃的食物，讀無聊的技術書籍，殺害了無辜的NPC，或是戒除藥癮，諸如此類。
[There are lots of options for increasing morale; reading an entertaining book, eating delicious food, and taking recreational drugs are but a few options. Most morale-boosting activities can only take you to a certain level before they grow boring.] 有許多的方法能夠增加士氣；讀一本有趣的書、吃美味的食物、甚至是服用一些興奮藥物。大部分能讓士氣高漲的活動只能在你變得無聊前讓你達到某種程度。
[There are various mutagenic substances, and consuming (or injecting) them will grant mutations. However, the process taxes your body significantly, and can be addictive. With enough mutations and certain conditions being met, you will permanently transcend your humanity into a wholly different life-form.] 遊戲中有各式各樣導致突變的物質，使用（或注射）他們將造成突變。然而，這個過程會改變你的身體特徵並且可能會上癮。隨著達到足夠的突變和一定的條件下，你將永遠改變你的外型成為一個完全不同的生命形式。
[There is a wide variety of items available for your use. You may find them lying on the ground; if so, simply press %s to pick up items on the same square. Some items are found inside a container, drawn as a { with a blue background. Pressing %s, then a direction key, will allow you to examine these containers and loot their contents.] 在遊戲世界中有許多種類的物品能夠使用。你可能會在地上發現它們；你能夠按 %s 來撿取腳下的物品。某些物品會在容器中找到，類似 { 亮藍色背景的符號。按 %s，選取方向，就能夠讓你檢視這些容器，並取得它們的內容物。
[There may be times when you want to move more quickly by holding down a movement key. However, fast movement in this fashion may lead to the player getting into a dangerous situation or even killed before they have a chance to react. Pressing %s will toggle "Safe Mode". While this is on, any movement will be ignored if new monsters enter the player's view.] 實際遊玩時你可能會想要透過持續按著方向鍵來快速移動。然而快速移動這個方法可能會將角色導入一個危險的狀況甚至於還沒反應過來就被殺掉了。按下 %s 將能夠切換"安全模式"。當開啟時，假如任何新怪物進入角色的視野，任何移動都會被忽略。
[Though it is relatively rare, certain areas of the world may be contaminated with radiation. It will gradually accumulate in your body, weakening you more and more. While in radiation-free areas, your radiation level will slowly decrease. Taking iodine tablets will help speed the process.] 儘管這狀況比較少見，某些地區可能會被輻射所污染。輻射線會慢慢的在你的身體累積並讓你漸漸衰弱。當你回到無輻射地區，你體內的輻射含量會緩慢的下降。服用碘片能夠讓這個過程加速。
[To attack a monster with a melee weapon, simply move into them. The time it takes to attack depends on the size and weight of your weapon. Small, light weapons are the fastest; unarmed attacks increase in speed with your Unarmed Combat skill, and will eventually be VERY fast. A successful hit with a bashing weapon may stun the monster temporarily, while cutting weapons may get stuck, possibly pulling the weapon from your hands-- but a monster with a weapon stuck in it will move much more slowly. A miss may make you stumble and lose movement points. If a monster hits you, your clothing may absorb some damage, but you will absorb the excess.] 要用近戰武器來攻擊一個怪物，只要向著它的方向移動。需要的時間仰賴於你武器的大小與重量。小而輕的武器是最快的；徒手攻擊能夠藉由提昇徒手戰鬥技能來增加速度，並且有可能達到極速的境界。一次成功的鈍擊攻擊可能讓怪物被短暫震暈，並失去它的行動點數。假如怪物擊中你，你的衣物會吸收部分傷害。
[To attempt to hit a monster with your weapon, simply move into it.] 要使用武器攻擊怪物，只要簡單的對著怪物移動。
[To craft items, press %s. There are seven categories: Weapons, Ammo, Food, Chemicals, Electronics, Armor, and Other. In each major category there are several smaller sub-categories. While a few items require no particular skill to create, the majority require you to have some knowledge. Sometimes a skilled survivor will work out a given recipe from her or his knowledge of the skill, but more often you will need reference material, commonly a book of some sort. Reading such references gives a chance to memorize recipes outright, and you can also craft while referring to the book: just have it handy when crafting. Different knowledge is useful for different applications:
] 要製作物品，按下 %s。總共有七種類別；武器，彈藥，食物，化學，電子，護具，以及雜項，每個主類別還有包含數個子類別。少部分的物品不需要技能就能夠製作，其餘的都需要你有某些知識才能製作。有時，一個熟練的倖存者能從他的技術知識做出一個配方，但更多的時候，你需要參考材料，通常是書籍。閱讀參考書讓人有機率，永久記住配方，你也可以透過參考書籍來進行物品製作：製作物品會更得心應手。不同的知識是在不同的應用上很有用：

[To disarm a trap, examine (press %s) the space it is on. Your success depends upon your Traps skill and Dexterity. If you succeed, the trap is removed and replaced by some or all of its constituent parts; however, if you fail, there is a chance that you will set off the trap, suffering the consequences.] 要解除陷阱，(%s) 檢視有陷阱的那格子。你的成功機率仰賴你的陷阱技能以及敏捷。假如你成功了，陷阱就會被移除，留下陷阱的零件；然而，若是你失敗了，將會有機率造成陷阱觸發，造成痛苦的後果。
[To select a fighting style, press %s. If you are already unarmed, this will make you start using the selected style. Otherwise, it will be locked in as your default unarmed style. To start using it, wield a relevant weapon or empty your hands, by pressing %s, then the key for the item you are currently wielding. If you wish to prevent yourself from accidentally wielding weapons taken from the ground, enable "Keep hands free" found in the styles menu.] 要選擇戰鬥招式，按%s，假如你已經徒手狀態將會讓你開始使用招式。不然就會被固定在你預設的徒手招式；要開始使用，手持相關的武器或是空出雙手，按下 %s 接著選擇你目前手持的物品鍵。若你要防止誤從地面撿持武器，在招式目錄啟用'雙手淨空'的功能。
[To set a trap, simply use the item (press %s) and choose a direction; the trap will be placed on an adjacent tile. Some traps may require additional tools, like a shovel, to be set. Once set, a trap will remain in place until stepped on or disarmed.] 要設置陷阱，只要使用物品 (%s) 以及選取方向；陷阱就會裝置在相鄰格子上。某些陷阱可能需要額外的工具，例如鏟子，才能被設置。只要設置好，陷阱就會一直是啟動的直到被觸發或是被解除。
[To wear a piece of clothing, press %s then the proper letter. Armor reduces damage and helps you resist things like smoke. To take off an item, press %s then the proper letter.] 要穿戴衣物時，按 %s 接著按下對應字母。護具能減少傷害並且幫助你抵禦一些狀況，例如煙塵。要脫下物品，按 %s 接著按下對應字母。
[To wield an item as a weapon, press %s then the proper letter. wielding the item you are currently wielding will unwield it, leaving your hands empty. A wielded weapon will not contribute to your volume carried, so holding a large item in your hands may be a good option for travel. When unwielding your weapon, it will go back in your inventory, or will be dropped on the ground if there is no space.] 要手持物品當做武器，按 %s 接著按下對應字母。再次手持同一物品則會讓你手持無物。手持的武器不會計算在你的儲物空間中，因此手持大型物品在手上，是一個搬運的好方法。當你不再手持的物品將會回到你的物品欄中，或是沒空間時會被丟棄在地上。
[Try to keep your inventory as full as possible without being overloaded. You never know when you might need an item, most are good to sell, and you can easily drop unwanted items on the floor.] 試著裝滿你的物品欄但是不要超重。你不知道何時會需要某個物品，大部分是能賣的貨物，而你也能簡單的就把你不要的物品丟棄在地上。
[Using firearms is the easiest way to kill an enemy, but the sound will attract unwanted attention. Save the guns for emergencies, and melee when you can.] 槍械是擊殺敵人的最簡單方法，但是聲響會引來不必要的注意。盡可能只用近戰，把槍留到緊急時再使用。
[Vehicle menu presents the most important parameters of your car, such as safe and maximum speed, current mass, total capacity and used volume of available cargo space, various fuel level indicators, and so on.] 
[When you take damage from almost any source, you'll start to feel pain. Pain slows you down and reduces your stats, and finding a way to manage pain is an early imperative. The most common is drugs: aspirin, codeine, tramadol, oxycodone, and more are all great options. Be aware that while under the influence of many painkillers, the physiological side effects may slow you or reduce your stats.] 當你在任何狀況下受到傷害，你將會感到疼痛。疼痛會減緩你的速度以及降低屬性，所以想辦法儘早處理疼痛是勢在必行。最普遍的方法是服用藥物；阿司匹林、可待因、曲馬多、可待因酮，以及其他更多的好選擇。但是要小心的是在止痛藥的作用下，一些生理上的影響也可能減緩你的速度或是降低屬性。
[While Cataclysm has more tasks to keep track of than many other roguelikes, the near-future setting of the game makes some tasks easier. Firearms, medications, and a wide variety of tools are all available to help you survive.] Cataclysm相對於其他 roguelike 遊戲有著更多的挑戰，近未來的設定也讓一些工作變得簡單。槍械、藥物、以及種類廣泛的工具都能夠為你的生存提供幫助。
[With the default Static spawn option, zombies in cities will spawn at the start of the game. All monsters are represented by letters on your screen; a list of monster names, and their positions relative to you, is displayed on the right side of the screen. If the world is set to use the Dynamic spawn option, you will have 90 minutes to prepare yourself before the spawns start; after that, monsters everywhere will be spawned based on the noise you make.] 當開啟怪物不刷新的選項時，城市中的僵屍會在遊戲開始時就產生。所有的怪物都會以字母表示在你的螢幕上。怪物的名稱和他們相對位置會顯示在你右邊的畫面。如果關閉怪物不刷新選項，在怪物開始產生前你會有90分鐘的準備時間。在那之後怪物將根據你製造的噪音刷新。
[You control vehicles using the numpad, or vikeys. However, you control their controls, rather than the vehicle directly.] 你能利用數字鍵盤或hjkl來控制車輛。然而，你是操作控制器，而非直接使用車輛。
[You may find doors, ('+'); these may be opened with %s or closed with %s. Some doors are locked. Locked doors, windows, and some other obstacles can be destroyed by smashing them (%s, then choose a direction). Smashing down obstacles is much easier with a good weapon or a strong character.] 你會看到有門， ('+')； 可能可以%s打開或是%s關上。某些門是鎖住的。鎖住的門，窗， 以及一些障礙可使用'砸'指令來摧毀(按 %s接著選方向)。拿著好武器或是力量大的人物能夠更簡單的把障礙摧毀。
[You must prepare to face the many hardships to come including dwindling supplies, hostile creatures, and harmful weather. Even among fellow survivors you must stay alert, since someone may be plotting behind your back to take your hard-earned loot.] 你必須準備面對許多困難，包括補給日益減少，敵對生物和有害的天氣。即使是同胞倖存者，你必須保持警覺，因為有人可能會策劃背著你把你辛苦賺來的戰利品搶走。
[Your character has a morale level, which affects you in many ways. The depressing post-apocalypse world is tough to deal with, and your mood will naturally decrease very slowly.] 你的角色有士氣等級，將會影響到許多方面。這壓抑的末日後世界令人難以接受，所以你的士氣將會慢慢的自然降低。
[Your clothing can sit in one of four layers on your body: next-to-skin, standard, over, and belted. You can wear one item from each layer on a body part without incurring an encumbrance penalty for too many worn items. Any items beyond the first on each layer add an additional 10 points to the body part's encumbrance. (However, you can wear one additional item that would be encumbrance 0 before fitting, and is fitted anyway, without incurring that penalty.)] 
[Your focus is also lowered by certain activities. Training your skills through real-world practice lowers your focus gradually, by an amount that depends on your current level of focus (higher focus means larger decreases, as well as improved learning). Training your skills by reading books decreases your focus rapidly, by giving a significant penalty to the set point of your focus.] 你的專注力也會受到特定狀況影響。透過實際練習來訓練你的技能會讓專注慢慢降低，數值取決於你目前的專注等級(較高的專注降低的越多)。藉由讀書來訓練你的技能會持續降低你的專注。
[Your focus level has a natural set point that it converges towards. When your focus is much lower - or higher - than this set point, it will change faster than when it is near the set point. Having high morale will raise the set point, and having low morale will lower the set point. Pain is also factored into the set point calculation - it's harder to learn when you're in pain.] 你的專注等級有一個自然會匯集的點。當你的專注力比這個點低或高，將會改變得較快直到靠近這個點。擁有高士氣將能提高這個點，反之亦然。疼痛同時也是影響這個點的因素，你受到疼痛時將會比較難以學習。
[[       Clothing
This may be worn with the %s key or removed with the %s key. It may cover one or more body parts; you can wear multiple articles of clothing on any given body part, but this will encumber you severely. Each article of clothing may provide storage space, warmth, encumbrance, and a resistance to bashing and/or cutting attacks. Some may protect against environmental effects.] [ 衣物

[A few days ago another survivor and I were trying to avoid the cities by staying in the woods during the day and foraging for gear at night. It worked well against the normal zed's but one night something caught onto our trail and chased us for ten minutes or so until we decided to split up and meet-up back here.  My buddy never showed up and I don't have the means to kill whatever it was.  Can you lend a hand?] 幾天前我和另一個伙伴試著避開城市，白天躲在森林中，晚上才出來蒐集物資。這個策略對付一般殭屍都很奏效，直到有一天晚上某個東西跟蹤並攻擊我們 10分多鐘，於是我們決定分頭逃跑並約好在這裡碰頭。我的伙伴都沒有出現而我也對這怪物束手無策，你能幫幫我嗎？
[Alcohol or lamp oil is probably easier to refine rather than find in large quantities.] 
[Although we are an agricultural outpost, we are restricted to growing plants that are compatible with the New England climate during the warmer months.  The easiest way to work around that is to build green houses to supplement our external fields.  There isn't going to be an easy way to build these, we are going to need a massive number of glass sheets to enclose the frames.  The first house will need 20 sheets of glass if you are still interested.] 
[America, fuck ya!] 我操你媽的美國！
[America, fuck ya!  I was in the guard a few years back so I'm confident I can make heads-or-tails of these transmissions.] 幹你媽的美國！我過去都在做後勤，所以我有自信能完整控制這些傳輸。

[Any luck?] 有消息嗎？
[Any luck? Please find me a small relic. Any relic will do.] 有找到嗎？請幫我找到小聖物。任何一種都行。
[Any problems boss?] 有問題嗎老大？
[Apparently one of the other survivors picked up on an unusually dense horde of undead moving into the area.  At the center of this throng there was a 'leader' of some sort.  The short of it is, kill the son of a bitch.  We don't know what it is capable of or why it is surrounded by other zombies but this thing reeks of trouble.  Do whatever it takes but we can't risk it getting away.] 明顯有一位生還者引動了這群異常地龐大的屍群到這個地方。在屍群的中心有一只領袖。你必須殺了這王八蛋。我們不清楚它的能力如何或是為什麼它會被屍群環繞著，但我們肯定它一定會帶來麻煩。用盡你一切的手段吧，我們不能冒險讓它逃脫。
[Are you going to forfeit your duty when the country needs you the most?] 你要在國家最需要你的時候放棄你的責任嗎？
[Are you sure?  The scientific value of that blood data could be priceless...] 你確定嗎？那血液資料的科學價值可能是無價的...
[As the world seems to abandon the reality that we once knew, it becomes plausible that the old superstitions that were cast aside may have had some truth to them.  Please go and find me a religious relic...I doubt it will be of much use but I've got to hope in something.] 雖然世界已經不像是我們所理解的現實那樣，這也讓一些過去被摒棄的古老迷信變得有一些可信度。請出發幫我找到一件宗教聖物.....也許會沒有用，但至少是我僅存的希望。
[Aspirin is pretty common in homes and convenience stores.] 
[Avoid destroying the furniture here, we'll be needing it.] 
[Avoid destroying the furniture, we'll be needing it.] 
[Before we get into a major fight just make sure we have the gear we need, boss.] 在我們大幹一場之前要有我們需要的傢伙，老大。
[Can't help you much, I've never even seen a plutonium battery.] 幫不了你，我從來沒看過有鈽電池。
[Cars can be found in traffic jams along roads or in parking lots... I'm sure you can find a few.] 
[Check with the nurse when you get a chance, I know she will need help setting up our clinic.  On the construction front, we are going to need to get dedicated scavenger teams setup to bring in the miscellaneous supplies that we use in small quantities.  We are going to start setting up a junk shop for them in the North end of the outpost so we could use your help with that.  Communication is the biggest obstacle for the teams... could you bring in a pair two two-way radios?] 
[Clothing that can withstand the wear and tear of climbing through windows and fighting back wild animals is in high demand.  The best that we have been able to field is leather body armor but it is difficult to make with our limited resources.  Could you craft us three pairs of leather body armor?  The life-expectancy of my scavengers would drastically increase if you did.] 
[Come back when you get a chance, we could use a few good men.] 有機會的話就回來，我們會需要像你的好人。
[Come back when you get a chance, we need skilled survivors.] 
[Come back when you get a chance, we really need to start reclaiming the region.] 有機會的話就回來吧，我們真的需要開始收復領土。
[Congratulations Marshal, don't forget your badge and gun.  As a marshal all men or women assisting you are considered deputy marshals so keep them in line.] 恭喜啊法警，別忘了你的警徽與槍。作為法警，所有協助你的男女都能夠考慮做為副手，所以請注意別讓他們亂來。
[Contractor, I welcome you aboard.] 承包商，歡迎同行。
[Damn, I maybe we can find an egg-head to crack the terminal.] 靠，也許我們可以找個方法來破解終端機。
[Damn, I'll have to find'er myself.] 靠，我看我自己找好了。
[Damn, we were so close.] 操，就差一點了。
[Deconstructing existing windows is the only way I know of to keep the sheets intact.] 
[Deconstructing furniture isn't going to be efficient, try looking for boxes or grabbing any sitting on top of rubble piles.] 
[Despite my recommendations, we continue to have travelers come in with illnesses I've been able to trace back to contaminated drinking water.  When boiling water isn't an option they need some form of charcoal water filter that they can use.  If you could build me four charcoal water filters I'll distribute them to groups as they pass through.] 
[Disease and infection remains a persistent problem among the refugees.  Without dedicated medical personnel and facilities I doubt everyone will be willing to stick around when the next outbreak happens.  Until we can get a former medic or nurse I'm just going to have to improvise.  Sterilization would be the first step I imagine.  Bring me five gallons of bleach so we can get started.] 
[Disease is spreading rapidly due to poor nutrition and there is little that I can do about it.  With food being scarce, people are willing to survive on whatever they can.  I need to start supplementing the outpost's diet with vitamins to prevent potential deaths indirectly attributable to nutrition.  I know it is a lot but if you could bring me 200 vitamins I'd be able to treat the most vulnerable before they spread anything to the rest of us.]

[Don't risk torching the building it may be hiding in if it has a basement.  The sucker may still be alive under the rubble and ash.] 別冒險燒了建築，它有可能躲在地下室。這混蛋可能會在殘骸中存活。
[Everyone who dies gets back up, right?  Which means that whatever is causing this it must be airborne to have infected everyone.  I believe that if that is the case then there should be regions that were not downwind from where-ever the disease was released.  We need to find a record of all the weather patterns leading up to the outbreak.] 死掉的人又爬起來了，對吧？這就代表不管是什麼造成的，一定是透過空氣傳染給每個人。我相信一定有個地方是處於上風而沒有受到疾病影響。我們需要災情爆發時的所有天氣記錄資料才能知道。
[Excellent!  This may be the key to removing the infection.] 超讚的！這也許是移除感染的關鍵。
[Excellent, thank you!] 太棒了，謝謝你！
[Excellent.  Take this vacutainer; once you've produced a zombie corpse, use it to extract blood from the body, then take it to a hospital for analysis.] 非常好。一旦你找到殭屍屍體後，利用這個真空採血器從殭屍身上將血液抽出來，然後帶到醫院分析。

[Finding the leather might be easier in town rather than making it yourself.]

[From what I understand, the creatures you encountered surrounding this relic were unlike anything I've heard of.  It is laughable that I now consider the living dead to be part of our ordinary reality.  Never-the-less, the church must have some explanation for these events.  I have located the residence of a local clergy man, could you go to this address and recover any items that may reveal what the church's stance is on these events?] 從我的理解，我從來沒有聽過這些圍繞聖物的生物。可笑的是，這些活死人已經是我們的日常生活中一部分。不管如何，教會一定會有這些事件的一些解釋。我已經找到了一個本地神職人員的住所，你能夠找到這個地址並發掘任何有關教會對於這事件立場的物品嗎？
[Fuck ya, America!] 幹你娘的美國！
[Getting a working vehicle is going to become important as the distance you have to travel increases.]

[Great work, wasn't sure what I was sending you after.] 做的好，儘管我不知道事後該給你什麼。
[Great, I know it isn't much but we hope to continue to expand thanks to your help.] 好了，我知道這不算太多，但我們能會繼續搜索下去，感謝您的協助。
[Great, I'll send word that we could use another set of hands or two to help out here.] 
[Great, anything I can't use to prosecute the bastards is yours, as promised.] 很好，只要不是能用來告這些混蛋的東西就如同承諾般，都歸你。
[Great, just let me know when you are ready to wade knee-deep in an ocean of blood.] 太好了，當你準備好浴血奮戰的時候就來告訴我。
[Great, let's see... uh... hmmm...  Fine, I didn't even do my own taxes but I'm sure this will prove their guilt if we get an expert to examine it.] 太好了，我們來看看... 喔...嗯... 很好。我雖然連自己都沒在報稅，但是我敢肯定要是我們有專家來查的話，這將能夠證明他們的罪。
[Growth has lately begun to stall, we have individuals passing through the outpost but the prospect of hard labor just to eek out an existence is driving them away.  We've asked around and decided that, despite our pressing needs, building a bar ought to draw some of the less committed individuals to the outpost.  Unlike other settlements, the more hands we have to more food we can produce... at least in the long term.  Unfortunately, no one here has brewed alcoholic drinks before so we are going to need you to find a book called the 'Homebrewer's Bible' or something along those lines.] 
[Has the leadership been dealt with?] 跟領導打交道了嗎？
[Have you completed your mission?] 你完成了你的任務了嗎？
[Have you dealt with them?] 你有跟他們打過交道嗎？
[Have you found my dog yet?] 你找到了我的狗嗎？
[Have you had any luck fabricating it?] 
[Have you had any luck finding a radio tower?] 
[Have you had any luck severing the connection?] 
[Have you heard of a book called the 'Guide to Advanced Emergency Care?'  I really need a copy.  The doctor is requesting a lot of supplies that I'm not familiar with but I believe I could make if I could get a copy of the book.] 
[Having any trouble following the map?] 跟著地圖走有問題嗎？
[Having at least basic equipment greatly increases survivability.  Thanks.] 
[Hell ya!  Find me one of those big ol' American flags.] 太讚了！幫我找到一面美國國旗吧！
[Hell ya, we may get ourselves killed but we'll be among the first legends of the apocalypse.] 太讚啦，我們可能會被殺掉，但是我們會成為災變後的第一個傳奇。
[Hey <name_g>... I really need your help...] 嘿 <name_g>... 我真的需要你的幫助...
[Hey, I know I wouldn't volunteer for it either.] 嘿，我也不是自願的。
[Hey, I know I wouldn't volunteer for it either... but then I remember that most of us survivors won't make it unless someone decides to take the initiative.] 嘿，你知道我不是自願的吧... 但是我後來想到如果不採取主動的話，大部分的倖存者都會無法存活。
[Holy hell, the crash you recovered the black box from wasn't as old as I thought.  Check this out, it was on its approach to pick up a team sent to secure and destroy something called a 'Hazardous Waste Sarcophagus' in the middle of nowhere.  If the bird never picked up the team then we may still have a chance to meet up with them.  It includes an access code for the elevator and an encoded message for the team leader, I guess.  If we want to join up with what remains of the government then now may be our only chance.] 見鬼了，你找到黑盒子的那個墜機地點是沒多久之前出事的。你看看，這飛機是要去接送某個隊伍，他們被派遣去保全並摧毀某個叫'危險廢料石棺'的地點。要是這大鳥沒有去接應這隊伍也許我們還有機會能跟他們碰頭。裡面還有電梯的通行代碼以及給領隊的加密訊息。要是我們想要加入政府剩下的人，這也許就是我們的唯一機會了。
[Homes, hospitals, labs, and doctor offices would be where I'd check.] 
[Hopefully we will be able to assign new migrants to help fulfill our needs in the future.] 
[Hospitals and crafting stores should have a few.] 
[Hospitals or clinics might have a few sitting around.] 
[Hospitals or clinics might have a few that haven't been used.] 
[How 'bout that black box?] 黑盒子找的如何了？
[How am I not dead already?!] 為什麼我還沒死?!
[How is the hunt going?] 
[How is the search going?] 搜索得如何？
[I appreciate it.] 
[I appreciate the work you do.] 
[I bet some of them are still out there...] 我猜還有一些還在那...
[I bet you'll run into a lot of those things in the hospital, please be careful.] 我猜你可能會闖進有一大堆殭屍的醫院，所以請你小心。
[I can usually use additional survival gear to kit-out the new recruits.  The most basic weapon that everyone gets is the knife spear... it provides a good mix of range, power, and ease of use when engaging the more common monsters.  Could you make me a dozen of them?  I may need more later but that should help the first few teams.] 
[I can't thank you enough for bringing me the patient records but I do have another request.  You seem to know your way around... could you take me to one of the FEMA camps?  I know some were overrun but I don't want to believe all of them could have fallen.] 我對你的感謝已經無法用言語形容了，但是我還有另一個請求。你似乎是有能力的人...你能夠帶我到其中一個急難救助營嗎？我知道這要求有點超過，但是我不想相信全部的人都已經淪陷了。
[I could always use you to put another repeater mod up.  I don't have to remind you but every one that goes up extends our response area just a little bit more.  With enough of them we'll be able to maintain communication with anyone in the region.] 
[I don't know the exact recipie but I'm sure you could make it from a comercial fertilizer or produce it from bonemeal.] 
[I don't know why you would bother wasting your time down here if you can't handle a few small tasks...] 
[I don't like sending untested men into the field but if you have stayed alive so far you might have some skills.  There are at least a pair of bandits squatting in a local cabin, anyone who preys upon civilians meets a quick end... execute both of them for their crimes.  Complete this and the Old Guard will consider you an asset in the region.] 我不太喜歡讓陌生的人加入我們，但你存活了這麼久想必相當有一套。現在有個小屋被至少兩個以上土匪佔據，他們盯上的獵物都難逃一劫... 去解決掉他們，他們必須為犯下的罪行負責。完成後老警衛就會把你當成是這裡的一員。
[I don't think so...] 我不這麼認為...
[I don't think that was quite a hundred dead zeds.] 我不覺得會有上百個殭屍。
[I don't think we got it yet.] 我不覺得我們得手了。
[I don't think you're going to find many other survivors who haven't taken up a faction yet.] 我不認為你能找到很多沒有加入派系的倖存者。
[I doubt the site is still occupied but I'd carry a firearm at least... I'm not sure what you might be looking for but I'm positive you'll find something out of the ordinary if you look long enough.] 我想那地點應該依然是被佔據的狀態，所以我至少會帶一些槍械... 我不確定你會找到什麼，但要是你仔細找的話，我認為你會找到一些不尋常的東西。
[I got the brief so I know what I'm getting into.  Let me be upfront, treat me like shit and I'm going to cover my own hide.  Without a strong band a man doesn't stand a chance in this world.  You ready to take charge boss?] 我有接到簡報所以我知道我涉入了什麼事。讓我先聲明，對我不好的話，我就也只會顧自己。孤軍奮戰的話在這個世界是沒有任何機會的。老大，你準備好要負責了嗎？
[I guarantee we will toast to your name when the bar is finished.] 
[I guess I could use your skills once again.  There are small transmitters located in the nearby evacuation shelters; if we don't separate them from the power grid their power systems will rapidly deteriorate over the next few weeks.  The task is rather simple but the shelters offer us a place to redirect refugees until this vault can be secured. ] 
[I guess it was just a pipe dream.] 我猜這只是在做夢。
[I guess this wasn't as bright an idea as I thought.] 我猜這不是一個好的主意。
[I guess you should search homes or libraries?] 
[I have another task if you are feeling up to it.  There is a prisoner that the priest made special mention of.  I was wondering if you could see what may have happened to him or if he left anything in his cell.  The priest admits the individual is rather unstable, to put it lightly, but the priest personally believed the man was some kind of repentant visionary.  I'm not in a position to cast out the account just yet... it seems the man has prophesied  events accurately before concerning the Church of Starry Wisdom.] 如果你願意的話，我還有另一個任務。牧師特別提到了一位囚犯。我在想，如果你能瞭解發生在他身上的事，或是他留在牢房的東西。牧師已經承認這人非常不穩定，雖然只是輕描淡寫，但是某種懺悔的跡象。我不目前還無法瞭解囚犯的想法...不過似乎之前他對星慧教堂的相關預言都非常準確。
[I heard that we may have a physician on his way here.  The workers have already begun expanding the clinic but I need you to locate a pair of scalpels to use in surgery when he arrives.  I'm sure you should be able to find them in a hospital or craft shop.] 
[I hope I don't see many names I know...] 希望不要看到太多我認識的名字...
[I hope the bastard is packing heat... else we'll need to grab him a gun before we hit our next target.] 我希望那混蛋最好自備家私...不然我們還要在修理下個目標前幫他找把槍。
[I hope you will find use from what you got out of the deposit box but I also have another job for you that might lead you to an opportunity to deal out justice for those who cannot.  First things first, we can't just look like ruffians.  Find us a deputy badge, easy enough?] 我希望保險箱裡面有你想要的東西，而我還有另一件工作，也許能夠讓你有機會主持正義。首先，我們不能看起來像流氓。找個副警長徽章，簡單吧？
[I just need a place to start over...] 我只是需要一個重新開始的地方...
[I know it isn't pressing but the big corporations didn't get a chance to destroy the evidence yet.] 我知道這不是很急迫，但是這些大企業可能會有機會銷毀這些證據。
[I know it isn't pressing but the world is going to be just as corrupt when we start rebuilding unless we take measure to stop those who seek to rule over us.] 我知道這不是很急迫，但是我們若是沒有採取行動的話，這世界重建之時將會一樣腐敗。
[I left my poor dog in a house, not far from here.  Can you retrieve it?] 我把我可憐的狗狗忘在家了，離這裡不遠。你可以幫我帶他回來嗎？
[I need someone to get a sample of zombie blood, take it to a hospital, and perform a centrifuge analysis of it.] 你需要有人去採集殭屍的血液，拿到醫院去，並作離心分析。
[I suppose a large church or cathedral may have something.] 我想大的教會或是大教堂也許會有些東西。
[I was given a few bottles of bleach when I arrived but I need a number of hotplates to actually sterilize equipment.  I'm sure you can find them in any old house or appliance store.  Three should be enough for now.] 
[I wish you the best of luck, may whatever god you please guide your path.] 我會為你祝福，也祈禱神帶領你找到方向。
[I wish you the best of luck, may whatever god you please guide your path...  I can only imagine that the prison will be a little slice of hell.  I'm not sure what they would have decided to do with the inmates when they knew death was almost certain.  ] 我會為你祝福，也祈禱神帶領你找到方向... 我只能想像那監獄根本是地獄的翻版。當這些囚犯死期將近的時候，我不知道他們會對這些人做出什麼事。  
[I wish you the best of luck, may whatever god you please guide your path...  You may need it this time more than the past excursions you have gone on.  There is a note about potential human sacrifice in the days immediately before and after the outbreak.  The name of the cult is believed to be the Church of Starry Wisdom but it is noted that accounts differ.] 我會為你祝福，也祈禱神帶領你找到方向...你會比以前更需要的。有一個關於正好在大爆發之前的人類獻祭記錄。邪教的組織應該是在星慧教堂聚集，但是也可能有不同的說法。
[I wonder if a retreat might exist...] 我想應該沒有退路了...
[I'd carry a shotgun at least, it sounded pretty big.] 我會至少帶把散彈槍，這怪物好像很大一隻。
[I'd check the police station.] 我會檢查警察局。
[I'd look through a few basic chemistry books to find a simple recipe.] 
[I'd recommend having two deputies... it would be a death trap if a single man got surrounded.] 我建議找兩位副手... 要是一個人被包圍的話必死無疑。
[I'd secure an ammo cache and try to sweep a town in multiple passes.] 我會保留彈藥並且試著多次掃蕩城鎮。
[I'd start with looting hotels or you could sew them together... but that would be a last resort.] 
[I'll be standing by down here once you are done.] 
[I'll be standing by.] 
[I'll lend you a hand but I'd try and recruit another gunslinger if you can.] 我會助你一臂之力，但是你還是盡量再找到另一個槍手當同伴。
[I'll try and update the captain with any signals that I need investigated.] 
[I'm a pretty good shot with a rifle or pistol.] 我對使用步槍或手槍滿在行的。
[I'm counting on you.] 
[I'm glad you came back alive... I wasn't sure if I had sent you to your death.] 我很高興你活著回來...我都不確定是不是派你去送死了。
[I'm impressed with your abilities.] 
[I'm infected.  Badly.  I need you to get some antibiotics for me...] 我被嚴重感染了。我需要你幫我拿些抗生素...
[I'm not sure, maybe a news station would have what we are looking?] 我不確定，也許新聞電台會有我們要找的東西？
[I'm positive there is something there... there has to be, any luck?] 我很肯定那裏一定會有什麼... 一定有，你有消息嗎？
[I'm sure the motorpool has a truck battery you could salvage.] 
[I'm sure the outpost will expand quickly with your assistance.] 
[I'm sure the scavengers will find these useful.] 
[I'm sure you can find bleach in most homes...] 
[I'm sure you could find the design for the stills in home brewing books.] 
[I'm sure you've noticed the new workers that have started trickling in.  The Free Merchant counsel is demanding that we immediately begin projects to become self-sufficient due to limited supplies.  We are going to need to rapidly setup an agricultural industry before winter and starvation catches us unprepared and unsupported.  In order to get a half dozen shovels and a couple of bags of seeds, we are going to have to trade for it.  I've already got the deal lined up but the only thing they are willing to trade it for is salt.  I negotiated them down from 500 units to 300... we were hoping you might have access to a source.] 
[I've accepted that everyone I used to know is dead... one way or another.  I really wish I could have done something to save my brother but he was one of the first to go. I'd like to start over, just rebuild at one of the farms in the countryside.  Can you help me secure one?] 我已經接受了我認識的人全都死亡的事實了... 不論何種方式。我真的希望我能夠做點什麼來救我兄弟，但是他是先走的其中之一。我想要重新來過，就是到郊區的農場進行重建。你能夠幫我清理出一塊農場嗎？
[I've been working on producing some of our own medical supplies but I'm going to need a chemistry set to get everything that I need in order.  Is there any way you could go through one of the school chemistry labs and steal me a chemistry set?] 
[I've got a handful of bandages and a few first aid kits to work with at the moment... in other words I'm completely unable to treat most serious medical emergencies.  I'm supposed to have priority on any medical supplies that the scavengers bring in but I imagine the black market for the stuff will prevent me from ever seeing it.  I could use your help getting a few bottles of aspirin to start with.] 
[I've heard some bad rumors so I hope you are up for another challenge...] 我有聽到一些不好的謠言，所以我希望你準備好對付另一個挑戰了...
[I've located a Hell's Raiders encampment in the region that appears to be coordinating operations against the Free Merchants.  We know almost nothing about the command structure in the 'gang' so I need to send someone in to decapitate the leadership.  The raid will be held under orders of the U.S. Marshals Service and by agreeing to the mission you will become a marshal, swearing to assist the federal government in regaining order.] 我已經定位了地獄掠奪者在本區域的營地，這似乎是與自由商會互相牴觸的狀況。我們知道'幫派'的幾乎沒有組織倫理可言，因此我需要派某人去把領導除掉。這次突襲是美國聯邦執法官署直接下的命令，若你同意這個任務你將成為一位法警，誓言協助聯邦政府恢復秩序。
[I've lost so many friends... please find me a patient list from the regional hospital or doctor's office.  I just want to know who might still be out there.] 我已經失去了許多朋友... 請幫我從醫院或是診所找到病人名單。我只是想知道還有誰活著。
[If only we could find a great valley or something.] 要是我們能找到類似大河谷之類的地方就好了。
[If the information is confidential the priest must have it hidden within his own home.] 假如情報是保密的，那麼牧師一定會把它藏在他自己家裡。
[If there is a military team down there then we better go in prepared if we want to impress them.  Carry as much ammo as you can and prepare to ditch this place if they have a second bird coming to pick them up.] 那如那裡面有軍隊的話，我們最好做好準備來讓他們大吃一驚。在他們有另一支大鳥來接他們之前，帶上所有你能帶的彈藥並離開這個地方。
[If they draw first blood their friends are less likely to blame you...] 假如是他們先動手的話，他們的朋友就沒什麼好責難你的...
[If you can do this for us our survival options would vastly increase.] 如果你可以幫我們作這件事，我們生存下去的可能性會大幅度提高。
[If you can find a source of salt water you should be able to boil it down.] 
[If you can't find a large supply I'd recommend checking hospitals or research labs.] 
[If you can, get a friend or two to help you.] 要是可能的話，帶一兩個朋友幫忙你。
[If you could make some sort of directional antenna, it might help locating the radio stations.] 
[If you really want to lend a hand we could use your help clearing out the dead in the back bay.  Fearful of going outside during the first days of the cataclysm we ended up throwing our dead and the zombies we managed to kill in the sealed back bay.  Our promising leader at the time even fell... he turned into something different.  Kill all of them and make sure they won't bother us again.  We can't pay much but it would help us to reclaim the bay.] 如果你真的想幫我們，可以去把後灣的殭屍清掉。大災變發生的第一天我們都慌慘了，只好把充滿殭屍的後灣區封鎖起來。我們原本抱持著希望的領導者最後也放棄了... 甚至變得我們都認不出來。 去把後灣區清光，讓我們不再受到威脅。我們沒辦法給你什麼，但至少這能幫我們奪回後灣區。
[If you take a shovel to a pile of rubble you should be able to pull out structural grade stone.] 
[It could be very informative to perform an analysis of zombie blood...] 要是能對殭屍的血液進行分析將會是很有用的情報...
[It may be easier to make them if you can't find a school or something.] 
[It should be a fairly common item, don't know what else to say.] 
[It was a lost cause anyways...] 反正都失敗了...
[Just flipping through the book I can tell that one ingredient in most of the alcoholic drinks that we don't have a large supply of is sugar.  What alcohol we have been able to loot isn't going to last us long so starting our first large batch is a priority.  Could you bring in 80 units of sugar?  That should last us until we can start producing our own supply.] 
[Just follow your map.] 
[Libraries are the only place I'd think to look.] 
[Man... you're a goddamn machine.  It was a pleasure working with you.  You know, you may just change our little neck of the world if you keep this up.] 大哥...你真是無敵的殺戮機器。和你一起行動真是榮幸。你知道，你可能讓這世界更有希望了。
[May that bastard never get up again.] 希望這混蛋再也不要爬起來了。
[Maybe they escaped to one of the camps...] 也許他們逃脫到某個營地了...
[Mining would always be an option if you had the resources.] 
[Most of my essential gear has been brought back online so it is time for you to install your first radio repeater mod.  Head topside and locate the nearest radio station.  Install the mod on the backup terminal and return to me so that I can verify that everything was successful.  Radio towers must unfortunatly be ignored for now, without a dedicated emergency power system they won't be useful for some time.] 
[My chief responsibility is to monitor radio traffic and locate potential targets to secure or rescue.  The majority of radio repeaters are down and those that are working have only emergency power.  If you have a basic understanding of electronics you should be able to fabricate  the 'radio repeater mod' found in these plans.  When this mod is attached to a radio station's main terminal, all short range radio traffic on emergency channels is boosted so we can pick it up at much longer ranges.  I really need you make me one.] 
[My communications team went to secure the radio control room after we breached the facility.  I haven't heard from them since, I need you to locate them.  Their first objective was to record all active channels that were transmitting information on other survivors or facilities.  Find them and return the frequency list to me.  I'm sure they could probably use your help also.] 
[My mom... she's... she was killed, but then she just got back up... she's one of those things now.  Can you put her out of her misery for me?] 我媽... 她 ... 她被殺了，但是沒多久她又爬起來了... 她現在已經變成那種東西了。你可以幫我讓她解脫嗎？
[Night is the ideal time for my team to go on raids but they are going to need better light sources to speed up their missions.  Could you craft a set of five wearable flashlights for them?  Keeping both hands free greatly helps during combat.] 
[Now I don't mean to upset you but I'm not sure what I can do with the accounting ledger at the moment.  We do have a new lead though, the ledger has a safe deposit box under the regional manager's name.  Guess what, dumb sucker wrote down his combination.  Come with me to retrieve the box and you can keep any of the goodies in it that I can't use to press charges against these bastards.] 我並不是要打擊你，但是我不確定目前我們能拿這財務報表怎麼辦。但是我們有新的線索，這報表中有記載一個掛著區域經理名字的保險箱。你看看，有個智障居然寫了他的密碼在上面。跟我一起去取得保險箱，而你可以留著其他我不能用來告這些混蛋的其他東西。
[Oh dear, I thought Timmy would have made it...] 喔老天，我以為 Timmy 能熬過來的...
[Oh god, I can't believe it happened...] 我的天哪，我不敢相信這是真的...
[Oh god, it <swear> hurts...] 我的天啊，真<swear>痛...
[Oh man, I can't believe I forgot to download it...] 喔不，我不敢相信我居然忘記下載了...
[Oh no!  My poor puppy...] 喔不！我可憐的狗狗...
[Oh thank god!  I'll be right as rain in no time.] 喔太感謝你了！真的是及時雨啊。
[Oh, my poor puppy...] 喔，我可憐的狗狗...
[Oh, thank god, thank you so much!  I won't last more than a couple of days, so hurry...] 喔，感謝老天爺，真是謝謝你！我也許只能再撐幾天而已了，所以請趕快...
[Organizing the scavenging missions is difficult enough without communication.] 
[Our community survives on trade, we appreciate it.] 我們的社區藉由交易才能生存下去，感謝大家的互助。
[Our current assessment for survivability has increased significantly thanks to your efforts.  The next priority issue is securing a cleaner water source.  Drinking from the pond on the back end of the ranch has led to an outbreak of dysentery.  As quickly as possible we need to improve the sanitary conditions in the camp.  To do so the first step is to dig a well and construct stone fireplaces in the barn for the migrants to boil water.  We are going to need at least 75 large rocks from you if we hope to accomplish the task before we all get sick.  After we have them installed you will have free access to them, guaranteed. ] 
[Our first project is to enclose the barn so that new refugees have a safe place to sleep.  Before we can begin serious improvements we need lumber to work with.  Enclosing the four barn entrances will take nearly 400 2x4's... if you could provide half of that we should be able to take care of the other half and construction.  If you don't have a truck, I'd make finding one your first priority.  ] 
[Our supply of nails has been depleted.  I'm going to have to ask you to get us a few more boxes.  Hardware stores should have a few if they haven't been looted.  I suppose you may be able to find handfuls of them in building rubble.  We'd need 2500 to have enough that we won't be sending you back out too soon.] 
[Our world fell apart because our leaders were as crooked as the con-men that paid for their elections.  Just find me one of those corporate accounting books and I'll show you and the rest of the world just who is at fault.] 我們的世界分崩離析是因為我們的領導者是用髒錢選出來的騙子。只要你能從這些企業中找到 企業財務報表 我就告訴你變成這樣子到底是誰的錯。
[Pipes are used in numerous metal constructions.  Smashing abandoned furniture may provide the material we need.] 
[Please be careful, we don't need any more deaths.] 拜託請小心，我們不需要更多的死亡了。
[Please reconsider, I know she's suffering...] 拜託你再考慮考慮，我知道她正在受苦...
[Please, I don't know what else to do.] 拜託了，我不知道還能做什麼。
[Please, I just don't know what to do otherwise.] 拜託，我不知道還能做什麼。
[Please, I just want to know what happened to everyone.] 求你了，我只是想知道大家發生什麼事了。
[Please, think of my poor little puppy!] 拜託，請為我可憐的小狗狗著想！
[Power for the motors will be provided by a salvaged truck battery, you need not bring additional mechanical components.  ] 
[Quitting already?] 要退出了嗎？
[Really... that's too bad.] 真的...那真是太糟了。
[Rescued the standard yet?] 找到國旗了嗎？
[Rodger, if he's a no-show then any other gunslinger will do... but I doubt he'll quit before we even begin.] 瞭解，要是他沒出現的話，那麼其他的槍手也行... 但是我覺得他會在我們還沒開始之前就不幹了。
[Salt is key to preserving meat and other perishables... without any excess food it wouldn't do us much good now but I imagine we'll need to send you out to get more in the future.  ] 
[Scrapping vehicles might be your best bet.] 
[Search the bushes for any trace?  I'm not an expert tracker but you should be able to find something.] 試試看搜索灌木叢有沒有任何痕跡？我不是一個專業的追蹤者，但你應該會找到一些東西。
[Seriously?  God damned commie...] 真的嗎？天殺的共產黨...
[Seriously?  It's an easy job...] 是嗎？這工作很簡單耶...
[Shall we keep looking for a farm house?] 我們是不是應該繼續找農場房屋？
[So, do you have my software yet?] 那麼，你拿到我的軟體了嗎？
[Something in the shadows still seems to stare at me when I look at the woods.] 當我看森林深處時，似乎有什麼隱藏在陰影中的東西正在盯著我。
[St. Michael the archangel defend me in battle...] 三太子賜給我力量...
[Sugar and molasses remains in short supply.  I've put in a request for more but it is unlikely that I'm going to see a reliable source for some time.  If you are interested, we are going to need sugar beet seeds to meet future demand regardless of what the scavengers can find.  Could you bring me at least enough seeds to plant a small 10 meter long patch?] 
[Survivors were talking about them crashing but I don't know where.  If I were a pilot I'd avoid crash landing in a city or forest though.] 我們提到的倖存者墜機了但是我不知道在哪。但是如果我是機長，我想我會避開在城市或是森林中迫降。
[Take my dog whistle; if the dog starts running off, blow it and he'll return to your side.] 拿著我的狗哨；假如狗狗跑走了，吹響這個狗哨他就會回來你身邊了。
[Take this USB drive.  Use the console, and download the software.] 拿著這個USB隨身碟。使用控制台，然後下載軟體。
[Thank you for the delivery.] 
[Thank you for your assistance.] 
[Thank you once again marshal.] 
[Thank you so much for finding him!] 非常謝謝你幫我找到他！
[Thank you!  Please hurry back!] 謝謝你！請儘快回來！
[Thank you, I need some time alone now...] 謝謝你，我想我需要一些時間獨處...
[Thank you, I suppose it won't change what has already happened but it will bring me closure.] 謝謝你，雖然我想這不會改變已經發生的事情，但是至少能夠讓我放下心裡的牽掛。
[Thank you, I'll do the explaining if anyone else asks about it.] 謝謝你，若是其他人問起的話，我會解釋的。
[Thank you, I'm not sure what to make of this but I'll ponder your account.] 謝謝你，我不確定是怎麼變成這樣的，但是我會考慮的你說法。
[Thank you, a diary is exactly what I was looking for.] 謝謝你，這本日記正是我要的。
[Thank you, having that big of a threat close to home was nerve wrecking.] 謝謝你，在家附近有這麼大的威脅會讓人神經衰弱。
[Thank you, just bring me to the camp... I just want to see.] 謝謝你，就帶我到營地吧... 我就是想看。
[Thank you, let's find a remote one so we don't have to worry about many zombies.] 謝謝你，我們找一個偏僻的地方，這樣我們就不必擔心會有很多殭屍出現。
[Thank you, please keep this discreet.] 謝謝你，請繼續小心謹慎。
[Thank you, the world is a better place without them.  Two of our more skilled individuals accepted the assistance of the Old Guard in setting up an outpost while you were out.  We didn't have many other options, refugees are still streaming in and we don't know what else to do with our limited food supply.  If you get a chance, you should see if they need your assistance in the future...] 
[Thank you, your account of these... demonic creations proves the fears the churches had were well founded.  Our priority should be routing out any survivors of this cult... I don't known if they are responsible for the outbreak but they certainly know more about it than I do.] 謝謝你所做的一切... 這些惡魔般的生物證明了教會的恐慌很有道理。我們的第一要務就是找出邪教中的生還者... 我不知道他們是否要對這個災情負責，但是我們肯定能從他們身上取得更多情報。
[Thank you.  I couldn't rest until I knew that was finished.] 謝謝你。這事結束後我終於可以好好休息了。
[Thank you... she would've wanted it this way.] 謝謝你... 我想她也會願意這麼做。
[Thanks for trying... I guess.] 謝謝你嘗試過了...
[Thanks so much, you may save both of us yet.] 非常的感謝，你也許救了我們。
[Thanks to your searching we've got the black box but now we need to have a look'n-side her.  Now, most buildings don't have power anymore but there are a few that might be of use.  Have you ever seen one of those science labs that have popped up in the middle of nowhere? Them suckers have a glowing terminal out front so I know they have power somewhere inside'em.  If you can get inside and find a computer lab that still works you ought to be able to find out what's in the black box.] 謝謝你的搜索我們才能找到黑盒子，但是我們必須要看看裡面有什麼。現在大部分的建築都已經沒有電力了，但是還是有些有備用電力。你有見過有些地方有突然出現的科學實驗室嗎？那些混蛋建築前門有發亮的終端機，所以我知道裡面一定有電。若是你能夠進入實驗室並找到台能用的電腦，你應該就能知道黑盒子裡面裝的東西了。
[Thanks!  Just pull the data onto this USB drive and bring it to me.] 謝謝！就只要把資料拷貝到這個USB隨身碟上再拿給我就好。
[Thanks, I know the labs on the other side of the complex have electronic parts sitting around.] 
[Thanks, I should be ready for you to install the radio repeater mods by the time you get back.] 
[Thanks, I'll see to installing this one.  It will be some time but I could use someone to position these around the region.] 
[Thanks, keeping the people safe is what we try and do.] 謝謝，讓人民安全一直是我們在做的事。
[Thanks, let me know when you need another tasking.] 
[Thanks, make sure you're ready for whatever the beast is.] 謝了，請你準備好對付這個野獸。
[That's one down.] 
[The Old Guard thanks you for eliminating the criminals.  You won't be forgotten.] 舊日守衛感謝你消除犯罪。你將會被銘記。
[The States will remain a wasteland unless good men choose to save it.] 若是沒有好人選擇拯救它，國家將仍是荒蕪之地。
[The bodily fluids that I often have to clean up and the caustic chemicals I deal with have done a number on my current pair of gloves.  Could you find me four pairs of heavy rubber gloves?  That should be enough that I can task a few laborers with cleanup details in the event of an outbreak.] 
[The centrifuge is a bit technical; you might want to study up on the usage of computers before completing that part.] 操作離心機會需要一些技術；你也許要先學習一些電腦技能才能完成這些操作。
[The day of reckoning will come for the corporations if it hasn't already.] 要是沒變成這種世界的話，清算這些公司的日子就不遠了。
[The day of reckoning will come for the criminals if it hasn't already.] 若不是變成這樣，清算這些罪犯的日子就要到來了。
[The doctor has some ideas on how to recreate a vaccination program for the common flu.  If you come across an unused flu shot please bring it to me.  We haven't had any fatalities from the flu yet but it is only a matter of time until one of the older or younger members of the outpost gets a bad case.] 
[The drinks we brew here have become a major draw for visitors and the occasional trader.  Our batches have become larger but we are still running out of storage space between trading runs.  I've been able to get a few volunteers to help me build a set of standing tanks but I still need 12 metal tanks to build them.  I've talked with the scrappers but we are a low priority at the moment.] 
[The eater of the dead... something was ripping zombies to shreds and only leaving a few scattered limbs...] 掠食活死人的怪物... 有東西把殭屍撕成肢體四散的碎片...
[The last batch that I brewed was terrible, I'm fairly sure something contaminated the yeast we have been using.  Could you locate a source of fresh yeast for us to use?  I'd need about 20 teaspoons of dry yeast to get started.] 
[The more men we can bring to the camp the quicker improvements can be made.] 
[The new outpost that we've started could use your assistance.  I need you to get the foreman's prospectus before we begin to send additional refugees to the farming commune.  Consult with the foreman to get more detailed tasks.] 
[The number of airway infections that I've encountered in the past week has depleted my supply of masks.  Could you find me 10 filter masks?  I tend to only distribute them in severe cases so I'll be sure to make them last.] 
[The only place I've seen them is garages but I imagine you could find them in some stores.] 
[The other survivor outposts that we have contact with have been more than eager to trade for beer or other drinks.  Transporting the drinks to them has presented a number of challenges though.  If you could locate a pair of 55-gallon drums we should be able to keep them supplied while turning a significant profit.] 
[The volunteers for the scavenging teams will need to be issued some basic equipment.  When the boss sets up shop in the junk shed you should ask him what else he needs for his teams.  In the meantime we can provide a few backpacks to get them started.  Could you find five backpacks to give to the initial team?] 
[The wine and beer we can brew are sufficient to attract most patrons but we need something a bit stronger to get them to forget their misery.  Could you build me a pair of stills?] 
[The work you have done has swayed the leaders at the refugee center to send someone out to assist with our medical needs.  The next step is for us to get a sort of chop-shop setup so that we can begin using scrap metal to build fortifications and equipment.  We are going to need a pair of electric welders for our mechanics to use.] 
[The worst case scenario will probably be that the prisoners have escaped their cells and turned the building into their own little fortress.  Best case, the building went into lock-down and secured the prisoners in their cells.  Either way, navigating the building will pose its own difficulties.] 最糟的情況就是囚犯逃出了牢房並把監獄變成了他們的堡壘。最好的情況就是監獄進入全面封鎖並讓囚犯保持關在牢房。不管哪種情況，要進入監獄都還是有一定的難度。
[There is a large group of thirsty individuals in our outpost that are truly thankful for your work.] 
[There is another monster troubling the merchants but this time it isn't human... at least I don't think.  Guy just disappeared while walking behind a packed caravan.  They didn't hear any shots but I suppose some raider may have been real sneaky.  Check out the area and report anything you find.] 還有另一個怪物困擾著商家，但這次不是人... 至少我覺得不像人。護衛在滿載的貨車後消失。他們沒有聽到任何槍聲，但我想這些強盜一定很擅於匿蹤。查看區域並回報你發現的所有事情。
[There's a town nearby.  Check pharmacies; it'll be behind the counter.] 附近有一個城鎮。檢查藥房，會在櫃檯後面。
[There's some important software on my computer that I need on USB.] 我電腦裡面有很重要的軟體，但是我還沒拷貝到USB上。
[These creatures can swing their appendages surprisingly far.] 
[These look more complicated than I thought, just give me some time.] 這些看起來比我想的更複雜，再給我一些時間。
[They might suspect you are coming, keep an eye out for traps.] 他們可能已經預料到你會來，請特別注意有沒有陷阱。
[They shouldn't be that hard to find... should they?] 這應該不難找到...應該吧？
[This infection is bad, <very> bad...] 這感染很嚴重，<very>嚴重...
[This is a bit more involved than the last request, we recently lost a scavenger party coming to trade with us and would like you to investigate.  We strongly suspect a raider band or horde caught them off-guard. I can give you the coordinates of their last radio message but little else.  In either case, deal with the threat so that the scavengers can continue to pass through in relative safety.  The best reward I can offer is a claim to the supplies they were carrying.] 這次的任務比上次的更複雜了點，我們最近跟常往來交易的拾荒者集團失聯了，希望你能去調查。我們強烈懷疑是強盜集團幹的或是他們遇到屍潮。你能給你上次無線電失聯時的座標，但就這樣而已。換個角度來看，若處理掉威脅後，拾荒者們就能夠繼續透過相對安全的路線來跟我們交易。我能提供給你的最好獎勵就是他們攜帶的貨物。
[This isn't what we need.] 這不是我們要的。
[This really should make the first winter easier to survive.] 
[This should let us start producing whiskey, rum, and brandy when we get access to the ingredients.] 
[This shouldn't be hard unless we run into a horde.] 要是我們沒有驚動到屍群的話應該不太困難。
[This task is going to require a little more persuasive skill.  I believe the Hell's Raiders have an informant here to monitor who comes and goes.  I need you to find out who it is and deal with them without letting anyone else know of my suspicions.  We normally allow the Free Merchants to govern themselves so I would hate to offend them.] 此任務將需要更多的說服技巧。我們相信地獄掠奪者在這裡有安排內線監視進出。我需要你去找出誰是內奸並處理掉，不能讓任何人知道是我發現的。我通常是允許自由商會自行管理，所以我不能夠得罪他們。
[Those twisted snakes...] 這些扭曲的蛇...
[To fabricate the well's hand pump and construct components for several other projects we are going to need to find or fabricate a number of steel pipes.  Plumbing is a distant possibility for now but some form of irrigation will eventually become desirable.  You could assist us with procuring 50 steel pipes, if you so have the chance.] 
[Traveling the backroads would be a good way to search for one.] 沿著小路走應該比較容易找到。
[Try a big corporate building of some sort, they're bound to have an accounting department.] 試試看去一些大公司的建築之類的地方，這些地方都會有會計部門。
[Try searching on the outskirts of towns.] 
[Wait, you couldn't possibly have the data!  Liar!] 等等，你不可能已經有資料了！騙人！
[Wait... are you really making me a deputy?] 等等...你真的要讓我當副手嗎？
[We are going to begin preparing our fields immediately.] 
[We are good to go!  The last of the gear is powering up now.] 
[We are starting to build new infrastructure here and would like to get a few new electrical systems online... unfortunately our existing system relies on an array of something called RTGs.  From what I understand they work like giant batteries of sorts.  We can expand our power system but to do so we would need enough plutonium.  With 25 plutonium cells we would be able to get an electrical expansion working for a year or two.  I know they are rare but running generators isn't a viable option in the basement.] 我們開始在這建設新的設施，並期望讓少數的新電力系統上線... 不幸的是，我們既有的系統仰賴一種稱作放射性同位素熱電機的陣列系統。據我了解這就像是一個巨大的電池之類的東西。我們能夠擴充我們的電力系統，但是這麼做的話，我們會需要足夠的鈽。有 25 個鈽電池就能夠讓一個電力擴充系統工作一到兩年。我知道這東西很稀有，但在地下室運作發電機不是一個可行的方法。
[We are starting to isolate a few natural antibiotic serums but we don't have the supplies to administer the cocktails.  I need you to bring me 10 empty syringes to use.  I'll take care of cleaning them to prevent transferring infections.] 
[We got this shit!] 我們拿到這玩意了！
[We have the basic equipment that we need but without a functioning power grid we are forced to rely on the readily available vehicle batteries.  This is going to be a chore but I'll need twelve car batteries to swap between charging and powering our equipment.  The good news is that they don't need to be charged, we can take care of that.] 
[We have the flag but now we need to locate US troops to see what we can do to help.  I haven't seen any but I'm figure'n one of those choppers that were fly'n round during th outbreak would have a good idea.  If you can get me a black box from one of the wrecks I'll look into where we might open'er at.] 我們找到了國旗，接著就是要找到美國軍方看我們能幫忙什麼。我還沒有見到軍隊的人，但是我想有其中一架直升機在災難發生時在附近飛。要是你能從殘骸中拿來黑盒子，我就能看看裡面有什麼消息。
[We need help...] 我們需要幫助...
[We should go at night, if it is overrun then we can quickly make our escape.] 我們應該夜晚再出發，假如失控的話我們還能快速的逃脫。
[We were briefed that the communications array was on this level.] 
[We'll begin planting our first seeds as soon as we can get these installed.] 
[We'll do our best to make them last...] 
[We'll go through this pretty quickly but it does help.] 
[We're also official... just hang in there and I'll show you what we can really do.] 我們也是官方了... 就掛著那東西，我來告訴你我們真正能做的事。
[We've got another problem to deal with but I don't think we can handle it on our own.  So, I sent word out and found us a volunteer... of sorts.  He's vain as hell but has a little skill with firearms.  He was supposed to collect whatever he had of value and is going to meet us at a cabin in the woods.  Wasn't sure how long we were going to be so I told him to just camp there until we picked him up.] 我們有另一問題要處理，而我不認為我們能夠靠我們自己對付。所以我放話出去並為我們找了個志願者...之類的。他雖然很瞎但是他對槍械還算在行。他去收集一些他認為有價值的物資並且會在森林小屋跟我們會合。我們不確定要花多久時間才會到達，所以我告訴他在那邊駐紮直到我們去接他。
[We've got the flag, now we need to locate US forces.] 我們找到了國旗，接著就是要找到美國軍方了。
[We've started planning a medical clinic but we are going to need a lot more supplies if we hope to warrant sending one of the few people with medical experience from the refugee center to our outpost.  I know first aid kits are rare but they have all the basic supplies that I'm uncertain of.  If you could bring in 3 full kits I'm sure we could supplement them to make them last a bit longer.] 
[Well damn, you must be the guys here to pick me up...] 靠，你一定就是來接我的人...
[Well, do you have the data yet?] 嗯，你有拿到資料了嗎？
[Well, my adventuring days are over.  I can't thank you enough.  Trying to make this place self sustaining will take some work but the future is looking brighter.  At least it ought to be safe for now.  You'll always be welcome here.] 那麼，我的冒險生活就結束了。我真不知道怎麼感謝你。要讓這地方能自給自足還有很多工作要做，但是我能看到比較光明的未來。至少目前是安全的了。我永遠都會歡迎你來。
[Well, our first crop will be planted shortly but I'm starting to suspect that our profit margin is going to be much smaller than we expect.  With limited seed for our original crop our next course of action is to increase the soil's fertility.  Is there any way you could find or produce a basic liquid fertilizer for us?  We'd need at least 30 units to make a significant improvement in our output. ] 
[Well...?  Did you... finish things for my mom?] 嗯...？你...讓我媽解脫了嗎？
[What a shame, that data could have proved invaluable...] 真糟糕，那資料也許是無價之寶...
[What good does this do us?] 有什麼好做？
[What's the use of walking away, they'll track you down eventually.] 逃跑幹嘛，他們最後也是會追蹤到你。
[What?!  I out'ta whip you're ass.] 什麼？！我要踹爆你的菊花。
[What?!  I out'ta whip your ass.] 什麼？！小心我揍死你。
[What?!  Please, <ill_die> without your help!] 什麼?! 拜託，要是沒有你的幫忙，<ill_die>！
[What?!  You liar!] 什麼?!你這騙子！
[What?!  You're lying, I can tell!  Ugh, forget it!] 什麼?!你居然給我裝孝維！哼，算了！
[When I was play'n with the terminal for the one I ran into it kept asking for an ID card.  Finding one would be the first order of business.] 當我在亂玩其中一部終端機時，它會跟我要 ID卡。去找一張 ID卡是進入實驗室的第一步。
[When outnumbered or forced to pull back my scavengers have been taught to throw Molotov cocktails to keep monsters from chasing them.  We go through one or two on every mission so we can always use a few more.  Would you be willing to make us a dozen?  I'm willing to pay you what I can for your assistance. ] 
[Will they be bothering us any longer?] 他們還會繼續煩我們嗎？
[With some basic survival and crafting skills you should be able to make them with little effort.] 
[With the barn entrances enclosed the refugees moving into there should feel safer but the weather can be bitter here.  We're going to need to build makeshift beds in the stalls to ward off disease and frostbite.  We can take care of the frames but will need your help looting blankets.  We'd need 25 blankets to provide the most basic sleeping accommodations.] 
[With the black box in hand, we need to find a lab.] 有了黑盒子，我們必須要找到間實驗室。
[With the well's completion we are rapidly closing the sustainability gap.  In order to expand from here we will need massive quantities of lumber to construct fortifications and new buildings.  We have already begun work on a manually operated sawmill but we will need two motors to control the actual blades.  We were hoping you might be able to secure the motors for us.] 
[With this we'll be able to convince others to invest in the commune.  Thank you.] 
[With two, we should be able to repair one if it breaks.] 
[Wow, you failed?  All that work, down the drain...] 哇咧，你失敗了？我的心血都沒了....
[Ya, I guess the stress may just be getting to me...] 好，我想我開始有壓力了...
[Ya, it was a long shot I admit.] 是，我承認這不太可能成功。
[Yeast should be common in homes or bakeries.] 
[You deal with the rat?] 你解決那些鼠輩了？
[You give up?  This country fell apart because no one could find agood man to rely on... might as well give up, I guess.] 你放棄了？這個國家分崩離析就是因為沒有人能找到值得依靠的好人... 我想我也放棄好了。
[You have no idea how interesting this diary is.  I have two very promising leads...  First things first, the Catholic Church has been performing its own investigations into global cult phenomenon and it appears to have become very interested in a local cult as of recently.  Could you investigate a location for me?  I'm not sure what was going on here but the priest seemed fairly worried about it.] 你絕對想不到這日記有多有趣。我有兩條非常有用的線索...第一條，天主教教會已經進行對於全球邪教現象的調查，而最近也顯示了本地的邪教組織變得很活躍。你能夠幫我找到邪教組織的位置嗎？我不曉得發生了什麼事，而牧師也似乎非常擔心。
[You look a little shaken up, I can't tell you how glad I am that you killed it though.] 你看起來有點受驚，我無法告訴你你殺了它我有多高興。
[You may be able to make one if you had the right guide.] 
[You may make a tidy profit from this.] 你可以從這得到很多好處。
[You might be able to find one in a pharmacy if you can't find a school.] 
[You might get lucky finding it but you could always boil it out of fruit if you are familiar with the process.] 
[You seem to know this new world better than most...] 你似乎比其他人更了解這個新世界...
[You should be able to find them in cleaning closets.] 
[You should be able to find them in electronics stores or at a police station.] 
[You should be able to make them with the most basic of skills.] 
[You wouldn't believe what I found...] 你絕對不會相信我找到什麼...
[You'll see, I know I'm right.] 你等著看，我知道我是對的。
[You're kitted out better than most... would you be interested in making this world a little better for the rest of us?  The towns have enough supplies for us survivors to start securing a foothold but we don't have anyone with the skills and equipment to thin the masses of undead.  I'll lend you a hand to the best of my ability but you really showed promise taking out that other beast.  You, I, and a 100 regular zombies laid to rest, what do you say?] 你的裝備比大多數人好...你有興趣讓這世界變得更好嗎？城鎮中有足夠的物資讓我們生存，但是我們沒有能足夠與殭屍周旋的技能。我會借你最好的人手，而你要承諾做掉怪物。你，我，讓 100個殭屍安息，你說如何？
[Your assistance is always appreciated.] 
[Your assistance is greatly appreciated, we need to clear out the more ruthless monsters that are wandering up from the lower levels.  If you could cull twenty or so of what we refer to as 'nightmares' my men would be much safer.  If you've cleared out most of this floor then the lower levels should be your next target. ]

Our radio equipment is utter garbage that someone convinced the government to buy, with no intention of it ever being used.  From the passing scavengers I've heard nothing but prime loot'n spots and rumors of hordes.] 我們聽到的沒有很多。大部分的避難所表面看來是設計讓人民感覺安全... 但實際上無助於生存。我們的無線電設備是徹底的垃圾，是政府跟某公司採購的，偷工減料的東西。從路過的拾荒者我只聽到主要搜刮點以及有關屍潮的傳言。

[Could easily be hundreds as far as I know.  They chose this ranch because of its rather remote location, decent fence, and huge cleared field.  With as much land as we have fenced off we could build a village if we had the materials.  We would have tried to secure a small town or something but the lack of good farmland and number of undead makes it more practical for us to build from scratch.  The refugee center I came from is constantly facing starvation and undead assaults.]

[Had one guy pop in here a while back saying he had tried to drive into Syracuse after the outbreak.  Didn't even make it downtown before he ran into a wall of the living dead that could stop a tank.  He hightailed it out but claims there were several thousand at least.  Guess when you get a bunch of them together they end up making enough noise to attract everyone in the neighborhood.  Luckily we haven't had a mob like that pass by here.] 前陣子有個來到這的人說他在災變後，曾經試著開著車進入雪城。都還沒到市區就遇到一堆殭屍海。他逃了出來並說那裏至少有上千的殭屍。想想看，一堆殭屍就會因為噪音而吸引更多的殭屍。幸運的是，我們這裡還沒遇過這樣的情形。

[I can't imagine what I'd need your assistance with.] 
[I can't leave the shelter without equipment...] 我不能沒有裝備就離開避難所...
[I chop up useless vehicles for spare parts and raw materials.  If we can't use a vehicle immediately we haul it into the ring we are building to surround the outpost... it provides a measure of defense in the event that we get attacked.] 
[I could use some food, here.] 這裡，我需要一些食物。
[I could use your medical assistance...] 
[I didn't mean it!] 我不是故意的！
[I don't belong to a faction, <name_g>.] 我並不屬於任何的派系， <name_g>。
[I don't care.] 我不想理你
[I don't have any jobs for you.] 我沒有可以給你的工作。
[I don't have any more jobs for you.] 我已經沒有可以給你辦的工作了。
[I don't know much about how it formed but it is the armada of military and commercial ships that's floating off the coast.

Most civilians are offered a cabin on one of the liners to retire to if they serve as a federal employee for a few years.] 我不太了解他形成的過程，但他是漂浮在外海的軍事與商業用船艦。他們從拖網漁船到超級油輪都有...甚至有一些北約組織的船艦。大部分的平民在退休後得到了一個客艙，慰勞他們做為聯邦雇員的幾年。
[I don't know what you could do.  I've tried everything.  Just give me time...] 
[I don't know, look for supplies and other survivors I guess.] 我不知道，我想應該就是蒐集物資以及找其他的生存者吧。
[I don't kowtow to any group, <okay>?] 我不聽命於任何人，<okay>？
[I don't personally, the teams we send out to recover the vehicles usually need a hand but can be hard to catch since they spend most of their time outside the outpost.] 
[I don't run with a crew.] 我沒有跟任何人合作。
[I don't think so] 我不這麼覺得
[I ensure that the citizens here have what they need to survive and protect themselves from raiders.  Keeping some form law is going to be the most important  element in rebuilding the world.  We do what we can to keep the 'Free Merchants' here prospering and in return they have provided us with spare men and supplies when they can.] 我確保平民能夠得到需要的物資來從強盜手中保護自己。保持某種形式的法律，將是在重建世界時最重要的一點。我們盡我們所能來保持 '自由商會' 蓬勃發展。做為回報，他們盡可能的提供我們人力與物資。
[I figured you might be looking for some help...] 
[I guess I'll look somewhere else...] 我想我該去別的地方找了...
[I guess you're the boss.] 我猜你就是老大。
[I have another job for you.  Want to hear about it?] 我有另一件工作給你。想要聽看看嗎？

[I have several jobs for you.  Which should I describe?] 我有許多工作給你。你想先聽哪個？
[I have several more jobs for you.  Which should I describe?] 我還有許多工作給你。你想先聽哪個？
[I haven't been here for long but I do my best to watch who comes and goes.  You can't always predict who will bring trouble.] 我在這裡沒有很久的時間，旦我盡力觀察進出的人員。你永遠無法預測誰會帶來麻煩。
[I haven't done anything wrong...] 我從來沒犯錯過...
[I haven't found one that's good enough for me.] 我還沒找到適合一起行動的人。
[I heard you were setting up an outpost out here...] 
[I hope you are here to do business.] 
[I imagine we might be able to work something out...] 
[I just have one job for you.  Want to hear about it?] 我只有一件工作給你。想要聽看看嗎？
[I keep getting sick!  At first I thought it was something I ate but now it seems like I can't keep anything down...] 
[I killed it.] 我殺了它。
[I might be back.] 我可能會回來。
[I need <ammo> for my <mywp>, got any?] 我需要 <ammo> 才能給我的 <mywp> 用，你有嗎？
[I need a gun, any kind will do!] 我需要把槍，隨便一種都好！
[I need help removing an implant...]

[I need some food, <very> bad!] 我 <very> 需要一些食物！
[I need some water or something.] 我需要喝些水或是其他的。
[I need to get past you, <name_g>.] 我需要過去，<name_g>。
[I need you to come with me.] 我需要你跟我來。
[I organize scavenging runs to bring in supplies that we can't produce ourselves.  I try and provide incentives to get migrants to join one of the teams... its dangerous work but keeps our outpost alive.  Selling anything we can't use helps keep us afloat with the traders.  If you wanted to drop off a companion or two to assist in one of the runs, I'd appreciate it.] 
[I oversee the food stocks for the center.  There was significant looting during the panic when we first arrived so most of our food was carried away.  I manage what we have left and do everything I can to increase our supplies.  Rot and mold are more significant in the damp basement so I prioritize non-perishable food, such as cornmeal, jerky, and fruit wine.] 我為中心負責糧食的庫存。動亂時有趁亂搶劫的情形，當我們初次到這時大多數的食物都被搶走了。我管理所剩下的並且盡可能的增加我們的補給。在潮濕的地下室容易出現腐壞與發霉的情形，因此我們優先考慮不易腐壞的食物，像玉米粉，肉乾及水果酒。
[I prefer to work uninhibited by that kind of connection.] 我比較喜歡沒有拘束的工作。
[I really don't feel comfortable doing so...] 這麼做讓我不是很舒服...
[I really need some <ammo><punc>] 我真的很需要一些 <ammo><punc>
[I run the shop here.] 我在這裡經營商店。
[I see.] 我懂了。
[I should be fine...] 
[I should be going...] 
[I should not be able to exist!] 
[I suppose I should hire a party then?] 我想我應該要雇用一個團隊？
[I suppose getting a car up and running should really be useful if we have to disappear quickly from here.] 
[I thought I smelled a pig.  I jest... please don't arrest me.] 我想我聞到了豬味。我開玩笑的...請不要抓我。
[I trade food here in exchange for a place to crash and general supplies. Well, more specifically I trade food that isn't stale chips and flat cola.] 我在交易中心做生意為了有地方住跟基本的物資。好吧，準確的說，我賣的不是過期洋芋片跟消氣可樂。
[I turn the logs that laborers bring in into lumber to expand the outpost.  Maintaining the saw is a chore but breaks the monotony.] 
[I understand...] 我了解...
[I was a practicing nurse so I've taken over the medical responsibilities of the outpost till we can locate a physician.] 
[I was among one of the first groups of immigrants sent here to fortify the outpost.  I might have exaggerated my construction skills to get the hell out of the refugee center.  Unless you are a trader there isn't much work there and food was really becoming scarce when I left.] 
[I was expecting the captain to send a runner.  Here is the list you are looking for.  What we can identify from here are simply the frequencies that have traffic on them.  Many of the transmissions are indecipherable without repairing or replacing the equipment here.  When the facility was being overrun, standard procedure was to destroy encryption hardware to protect federal secrets and maintain the integrity of the comms network.  We are hoping a few plain text messages can get picked up though.] 
[I was just a laborer till they could find me something a bit more permanent but being constantly sick has prevented me from doing much of anything.] 
[I was sent here to assist in setting-up the farm.  Most of us have no real skills that transfer from before the cataclysm so things are a bit of trial and error.] 
[I was starting to wonder if they were really interested in the project or were just trying to get rid of me.] 
[I was wondering if you could install a cybernetic implant...] 
[I won't last much longer] 我就撐不了多久了
[I work alone, <name_g>.] 我獨自工作，<name_g>。
[I'd like to hire your services.]

[I'm actually accepting a number of different foodstuffs: homebrew beer, sugar, flour, smoked meat, smoked fish, cooking oil; and as mentioned before, jerky, cornmeal, and fruit wine.] 事實上，我能夠接受許多不同的食物：私釀啤酒、糖、麵粉、煙燻肉、煙燻魚、烹飪油；同上所述，肉乾，玉米粉以及水果酒。
[I'm actually new...] 我其實是新來的...
[I'm collecting gear and selling it.] 我在蒐集裝備並且販賣。
[I'm currently waiting for a customer to return... I'll make you a deal though,  $8,000 will cover my expenses if I get a small cut of the loot.] 我目前正在等一位顧客回來... 但我還是可以跟你做個交易，假如我拿到一小部分的貨品，我將支付你$8,000。

[I'm just a hired hand.  Someone pays me and I do what needs to be done.] 我只是個傭兵。拿人錢財與人消災。
[I'm just a lucky guy that went from being chased by the undead to the noble life of a dirt farmer.  We get room and board but won't see a share of our labor unless the crop is a success.] 
[I'm just here for the paycheck.] 我來這只是為了酬勞。
[I'm just trying to survive.] 我只是努力活著。
[I'm just wandering.] 我只是四處流浪。
[I'm just watching the world burn.] 
[I'm leading what remains of my company on a mission to re-secure this facility.  We entered the complex with two dozen men and immediately went about securing this control room.  From here I dispatched my men to secure vital systems located on this floor and the floors below this one.  If  we are successful, this facility can be cleared and used as a permanent base of operations in the region.  Most importantly it will allow us to redirect refugee traffic away from overcrowded outposts and free up more of our forces to conduct recovery operations.] 
[I'm looking for clues concerning these monsters' origins...] 我正在尋找這些怪物的源頭線索...
[I'm looking for information...] 
[I'm looking for some choice systems to hack.] 我正在找可以駭入的系統。
[I'm looking for wounded to help.] 我正在找尋受傷需要幫助的人。

[I'm not tired yet. I'll go to sleep when I am.] 
[I'm on watch.] 我來把風。
[I'm one of the migrants that got diverted to this outpost when I arrived at the refugee center.  They said I was big enough to swing an ax so my profession became lumberjack... didn't have any say in it.  If I want to eat then I'll be cutting wood from now till kingdom come.] 
[I'm outta here soon!] 我要趕快閃了！

[I'm sick of fighting with my <swear> <mywp>, got something better?] 我已經厭倦用這<swear> <mywp>戰鬥，有沒有其他更好的東西？
[I'm sorry, I don't have anything to trade.  The work program here splits what we produce between the refugee center, the farm, and ourselves.  If you are a skilled laborer then you can trade your time for a bit of extra income on the side.  Not much I can do to assist you as a farmer though.] 
[I'm sorry, I don't have time to see you at the moment.] 
[I'm sorry, but the only way we're going to make it is if we keep our gates buttoned fast.  The guards in the basement have orders to shoot on sight, if you so much as peep your head in the lower levels.  I don't know what made the scavengers out there so ruthless but some of us have had to kill our own bloody kids... don't even think about strong arming us.] 我很抱歉，但是我們能做的就是讓大門關閉的快點。在地下室的守衛有格殺勿論的命令。我不知道為什麼拾荒者變得這麼狠，害得我們有些人不得不手刃自己的小孩...別想要我們武裝起來。
[I'm sorry, not a risk we are willing to take right now.] 我很抱歉，我現在不想要冒這個險。
[I'm sorry.] 我很抱歉。
[I'm sorry.  I did what I could.] 我很抱歉。我已經盡力了。
[I'm sorry... I failed.] 我很抱歉... 我失敗了。
[I'm supposed to direct all questions to my leadership, marshal.] 
[I'm sure I can do something to change your mind *wink*] 我想我可以做些事情來讓你改變決定 *眨眼*
[I'm tasked out to the construction party but I might be able to show you a few pointers that I've picked up.] 
[I'm the engineer in charge of turning this place into a working camp.  This is going to be an uphill battle, we used most of our initial supplies getting here and boarding up the windows.  I've got a huge list of tasks that need to get done so if you could help us keep supplied I'd appreciate it.  If you have material to drop off you can just back your vehicle into here and dump it on the ground, we'll sort it.] 
[I'm the region's federal liaison.  Most people here call us the 'Old Guard' and I rather like the sound of it.  Despite how things currently appear, the federal government was not entirely destroyed.  After the outbreak I was chosen to coordinate civilian and militia efforts in support of military operations.] 我是國家的聯邦聯絡官。這裡大部分的人叫我們'舊日守衛'而我還滿喜歡的。盡管大部份的事物都消失了，聯邦政府仍尚未完全被摧毀。在災難之後我被指派幫助平民以及民兵事務，以及支援軍事行動。
[I'm tired...] 
[I'm tracking game.] 
[I'm unaffiliated.] 我不結黨。
[I'm willing to pay $%.2f per batch. You have %d serving for a total of $%.2f. No questions asked, here is your cash.] 
[I'm willing to pay a premium for medical supplies that you might be able to scavenge up.  I also have a few miscellaneous jobs from time to time.] 
[I've got no time for you.  If you want to make a trade or need a job look for the foreman or crop overseer.] 
[I've got to go...] 
[I've heard that cougars sometimes leap. Maybe it's just a myth.] 我聽過美洲獅有時候會飛。也許這只是一個謎。
[I've taken care of it...] 
[INTIMIDATE] 威脅
[If it isn't obvious, I oversee the bar here.  The scavengers bring in old world alcohol that we sell for special occasions.  For most that come through here though, the drinks we brew ourselves are the only thing they can afford.] 
[If you don't get on with your business I'm going to have to ask you to leave and not come back.] 假如你沒有其他事，那麼我得要求你離開，並不得回來。
[If you have to fight your way out of an ambush, the only thing that is going to save you is having a party that can return fire.  People who work alone are easy pickings for monsters and bandits.] 假如你必須在埋伏中殺出血路，唯一能就你的就是能反擊的團隊。獨行俠很容易遇到怪物或強盜。
[If you need something you'll need to talk to someone else.] 
[Int %d - %d] 智力 %d - %d
[Interesting.] 有意思。
[Interesting...] 有意思...
[Is there a catch?] 重點是？

[The 2nd Fleet?] 第二艦隊？
[The Jabberwock is real, don't listen to what anybody else says. If you see it, RUN.] 變種人魔獸是真的，別管別人怎麼說。你要是看到了，逃吧。
[The rate is a bit steep but I still have my quotas that I need to fulfill.  The logs will be dropped off in the garage at the entrance to the camp.  I'll need a bit of time before I can deliver another load.] 
[There isn't a chance in hell!  We had one guy come in here with bloody fur all over his body... well I guess that isn't all that strange but I'm pretty sure whatever toxic waste is still out there is bound to mutate more than just his hair.] 在地獄裡根本沒有機會！曾經有一個全身毛皮的人來我們這裡...　好吧，我想這還不算很奇怪，但是我相當確信讓他突變的毒廢料不只是只有讓他長出毛皮這麼簡單。
[There isn't much pushed out by public relations that I'd actually believe.  From what I gather, communication between the regional force commands is almost non-existent.  What I do know is that the 'Old Guard' is currently based out of the 2nd Fleet and patrols the Atlantic coast trying to provide support to the remaining footholds.] 現在檯面上的關係沒有太多能讓我相信的了。據我所知，各區域的勢力幾乎是沒有互相聯繫的。我唯一知道的是， '舊日守衛' 目前是基於第二艦隊以及大西洋聯隊的殘存據點。
[They may just be propaganda but apparently one or two cities were successful in 'walling themselves off.' Around here I was told that there were a few places like this one but I couldn't tell you where.] 他們有可能只是在宣傳，但顯然的，一兩個城市已成功'隔離'。有人告訴我一些像這樣的地方，但是我不能告訴你在哪。
[This facility was constructed to provide a safe haven in the event of a global conflict.  The vault can support several thousand people for a few years if all systems are operational and sufficient notification is given.  Unfortunately, the power system was damaged or sabotaged at some point and released a single extremely lethal burst of radiation.  The catastrophic event lasted for several minutes and resulted in the deaths of most people located on the 2nd and lower floors.  Those working on this floor were able to seal the access ways to the lower floors before succumbing to radiation sickness.  The only other thing the logs tell us is that all water pressure was diverted to the lower levels.] 
[This is my territory, <name_b>.] 這是我的地盤，<name_b>。
[Tired] 疲倦
[To be honest, we started out with six buses full of office workers and soccer moms... after the refugee outbreak a day or two ago the more courageous ones in our party ended up dead.  The only thing we want now is to run enough trade through here to keep us alive.  Don't care who your goods come from or how you got them, just don't bring trouble.] 說老實話，我們一開始有六輛公車，滿載上班族和媽媽足球隊... 在災難爆發一兩天後，團隊中最勇敢的都死了。我們現在想要的就是讓交易通道順暢，我們才能存活。別在意貨物是從哪來的，就不會有麻煩。

[Was hoping for something more...] 要是有更多東西就好了...
[Watch your back out there.] 你在外面小心點。
[We are securing the external communications array for this facility.  I'm rather restricted in what I can release... go find my commander if you have any questions.] 
[We could look for one of those farms out here. They can provide plenty of food and aren't close to the cities.] 
[We don't put-up with garbage like you, finish your business and get the hell out.] 我們不想容忍像垃圾一樣的你，做完你的事，然後滾。
[We have a policy of keeping information to ourselves.  Ask the patrons if you want to hear rumors or news.] 
[We should probably stay away from those cities, even if there's plenty of useful stuff there.] 
[We're friends, aren't we?] 我們不是朋友嗎？
[We're here!] 我們到了！
[Welcome marshal...] 歡迎法警...
[Welcome to the junk shop...] 
[Welcome...] 歡迎...
[Well hey there.] 嗯,嘿,這裡。
[Well the refugees were staying here on the first floor when one their parties tried to sneak a dying guy in through the loading bay, we ended up being awoken to shrieks and screams. Maybe two dozen people died that night.  The remaining refugees were banished the next day and went on to form a couple of scavenging bands.  I'd say we got twenty decent men or women still here but our real strength comes from all of our business partners that are accustomed to doing whatever is needed to survive.] 難民們待在這裡的一樓，直到他們其中有人試圖透過裝載區偷渡一個垂死之人，最後我們被慘叫聲吵醒。大約有兩打人員死在當晚。剩下的難民在隔天被放逐，一部分的人加入了拾荒者集團。我想說的是，我們還有約20個可用的男女，但我們真正的力量來自於我們所有的事業夥伴以及做該做的事情來生存。
[Well, I am helping you out...] 因為，我正在幫你的忙...
[Well, I guess it's just us.] 嗯，我想只剩我們了。
[Well, I was kidnapped, but you saved me...] 嗯，我被綁架了，但是你救了我...
[Well, I was lost, but you found me...] 嗯，我迷路了，還好有遇到你...
[Well, there is a party of about a dozen 'scavengers' that found some sort of government facility.  They bring us a literal truck load of jumpsuits, m4's, and canned food every week or so.  Since some of those guys got family here, we've been doing alright.  As to where it is, I don't have the foggiest of ideas.] 嗯，大約有十幾人的'拾荒者'找到了某個政府設施。他們幾個星期定期就帶來一卡車的囚服、M4步槍以及罐頭食品。因為他們有家人在這，我們相處得還可以。至於這設施在哪，我沒有半點頭緒。
[Well, um, sorry.] 痾, 抱歉。
[Well... I was like any other civilian till they conscripted me so I'll tell it to you straight.  They're the  best hope we got right now.  They are stretched impossibly thin but are willing to do what is needed to maintain order.  They don't care much about looters since they understand most everyone is dead, but if you have something they need... you WILL give it to them.  Since most survivors have have nothing they want, they are welcomed as champions.] 嗯... 在他們徵召我之前，我一直就像是平民百姓，我就對你有話直說了。他們是我們目前的最大希望。他們會為了維持秩序不擇手段。他們不在乎小偷，自從他們了解到大部分的人都死了，但是如果你有他們需要的東西... 你 '將會' 給他們。自從大部分的生存者都已經沒有他們要的，他們受歡迎的程度像得冠軍一樣。

[Yeah, I'm sure.  Bye.] 耶，我很確定。掰。
